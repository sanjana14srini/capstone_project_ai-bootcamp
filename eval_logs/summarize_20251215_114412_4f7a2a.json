Before the beginning of the experiment, the moderator, in an attempt to build up a trusting \nrelationship between her and the children, engaged in a casual conversation, asking short questions such as: \u201cwhat is \n\nyour favorite super hero?\u201d or \u201cwhat is your best\u2019s friend name?\u201d. Amid these questions that the moderator asked so as \nto find a common ground with the child, there were four questions towards establishing the user\u2019s profile and facilitating \n\nthe analysis of the results: (i) \u201cHow old are you?\u201d, (ii) \u201cDo you play with your parents\u2019 tablet or smartphone?\u201d, (iii) \u201cHave \n\n9 \n\n\fyou ever played a programming game either computer-based or a board game?\u201d, and (iv) \u201cHave you ever interacted with \nan application using AR technologies?\u201d. \n\nQualitative Data. The moderator, who was sitting next to the child, was keeping notes with the use of a custom \nobservation grid appropriate for recording non-verbal child behavior (e.g. smiling, frowning) and emotions (e.g. happy, \n\noverwhelmed), as well as the child\u2019s comments. This type of data can reveal insightful information such as whether a \nchild is enjoying the game, which parts of the process require the most effort to complete, and their overall feelings and \n\nattitude towards the game at key moments (e.g. when successfully completing a task or when facing difficulties).  \n\nQuantitative Data. The observer was sitting behind the child and was using equipment that permitted viewing the \n\nscreen of the tablet (i.e. screen mirroring). Thus, the observer was able to record various information, such as interaction \nissues, errors during the rule creation process, and hints given by the moderator. The data concerning the interaction \n\nerrors can help reveal whether a child experiences difficulty with the selected interaction modality (i.e. AR), while the \ninformation  regarding  the  rule  creation  errors  can  reveal  whether  the  block-based  and  trigger-action  paradigm  are \n\nsuitable (i.e. supports children in identifying which facilities of an IE can be used and permits children to easily and \ncorrectly formulate the desired rule). Finally,  observing whether a  child required help for a specific  task is vital for \n\nuncovering potential issues. \n\nPost-study Questions. As soon as the session ended, the moderator asked the children six questions in order to \n\nunderstand their opinion regarding the  \u201cIntelligent  Living  Room\u201d, their  attitude  towards the game and its objective, \nwhether they faced difficulties and if they had any suggestions for improving it. Since young children can experience \n\ndifficulties in articulating their thoughts [104], and in order to avoid making them feel overwhelmed, they were asked \nfor their opinion indirectly. For example, instead of asking what they did or what they thought of the game, we asked \n\nthem to tell us how they would describe what they have done in the session to their best friend the next time they see \nthem, or what their younger sibling(s) might think of the game.  \n\n4.3 \n\nResults \n\n4.3.1  Q1: Can children (aged 7-12) comprehend the concept of IEs? \n\nThe concepts of IEs and Programmable Smart Objects were complex and unknown to all participants. However, our \n\nstudy revealed that through MagiPlay the children understood that they could program their surroundings in order to \nbehave in a specific manner. The latter increases in significance when considering that, during the introduction, the \n\nmoderator provided only a brief explanation of the concept and the capabilities of an IE and its artifacts. Children though, \nwhile playing, developed a good comprehension of what an IE is, what kind of functions it can execute to assist daily \n\nactivities, and why it is characterized as \u201cintelligent\u201d.  \n\nIn more detail, examining the  children\u2019s answers to the  question:  \u201cWhat  would you tell your best friend  that  you \n\naccomplished via MagiPlay?\u201d, we observed that the responses of 10 out of 15 children indicated that they apprehended \nthat the rules were the means to dictate the behavior of the house (e.g. \u201cI was able to program the house to do the given \n\nfour rules\u201d, \u201cI created rules and the game executed them\u201d). Additionally, 4 children provided answers signifying that they \nunderstood that the user can be in control of the environment (e.g.  \u201cThe game enabled me to state what I want to happen \n\nwhen something else happens\u201d, \u201cThe game allows me to open or close something when I want to\u201d). Interestingly, one child \n(an 8,5-year-old girl) provided a more sophisticated answer, stating that \u201cI made artifacts to do actions without the need \n\nfor me to  tell  them  what to do\u201d,  which suggests  that  she comprehended the essence of end-user programming.  Such \nresponses can reveal that children have achieved the \u201cKnowledge\u201d and \u201cComprehension\u201d level of intellectual behavior, \n\n10 \n\n\fdescribed in Bloom\u2019s"

Previous work already established that young children can learn programming basics. Yet, there is still a need to investigate whether this capability can be transferred in the context of IEs, since encouraging children to participate in the management of their intelligent surroundings can enhance responsibility, independence, and the spirit of cooperation. We performed a user study (N=15) with children aged 7-12, using a block-based, gamified AR spatial coding prototype allowing to manipulate smart artifacts in an Intelligent Living room. Our results validated that children understand and can indeed program IEs. Based on our findings, we contribute preliminary implications regarding the use of specific technologies and paradigms (e.g. AR, trigger-action programming) to inspire future systems that enable children to create enriching experiences in IEs.",

When several players exhibit time-inconsistent preferences, the resulting analysis involves two\ninterdependent levels of strategic interaction. At the inter-personal level, each agent\u2019s control affects the objectives of\nthe others, leading to the classical notion of Nash equilibrium among players. At the intra-personal level, each agent\nfaces a dynamic game against their future selves, induced by their time-inconsistent objectives. Each sophisticated agent\ntherefore seeks a sub-game\u2013perfect Nash equilibrium, that is, a strategy that constitutes an intra-personal equilibrium\ninternally and a Nash equilibrium externally. Equivalently, a sub-game\u2013perfect Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium\nacross both levels simultaneously: no agent has an incentive to deviate given the strategies of the others (inter-personal\nequilibrium), and no temporal self of any agent wishes to deviate given the continuation of their own strategy (intra-\npersonal equilibrium). Despite its relevance, existing literature on time-inconsistent problems has primarily focused on the\nsingle-agent case. Only a few works consider the multi-agent setting, where two intertwined levels of strategic interaction\narise. In the context of time-inconsistent contract theory, Cetemen, Feng, and Urgun [14] studied a contracting problem\nin which the principal exhibits non-exponential discounting, while Hern\u00e1ndez and Possama\u00ef [37] analysed the case of\na time-inconsistent sophisticated agent whose reward is determined by the solution of a backward stochastic Volterra\nintegral equation.

Huang and Sun [40] studied a mean\u2013variance portfolio optimisation game in which a finite number\nof investors determine their strategies under both full and partial information. To the best of our knowledge, only\ntwo works have explored this direction for large-population systems. Wang and Xu [63] considered a time-inconsistent\nlinear\u2013quadratic mean-field game, while Bayraktar and Wang [2] analysed the convergence of equilibria in N -player\ngames toward a mean-field game equilibrium in a discrete-time Markov decision game with non-exponential discounting.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this paper, we develop a general framework for non-cooperative stochastic games with finitely many players, formulated\nunder the weak formulation, in which the drift of each player\u2019s state process depends on the states and controls of all\nagents.

A strategy that resolves this internal dynamic\nis called an intra-personal equilibrium and it has been extensively studied in the literature. In discrete time, the notion of\nintra-personal equilibrium is widely agreed upon and provides a mathematical formulation of Strotz\u2019s ideas. However, in\ncontinuous time, several alternative definitions have been proposed to capture the subtleties of temporal consistency. The\nmost widely adopted formulation is the first-order approximation approach, known as weak intra-personal equilibrium\nand pioneered by [24].

Focusing on non-cooperative interactions, Huang and Zhou [42] investigated a non\u2013zero-sum Dynkin\ngame in discrete time under non-exponential discounting, while Lazrak, Wang, and Yong [49] analysed a linear\u2013quadratic\nzero-sum game in which the two players discount performance at a non-constant rate when lobbying for investment in a\nwind turbine farm. Huang and Sun [40] studied a mean\u2013variance portfolio optimisation game in which a finite number\nof investors determine their strategies under both full and partial information. To the best of our knowledge, only\ntwo works have explored this direction for large-population systems. Wang and Xu [63] considered a time-inconsistent\nlinear\u2013quadratic mean-field game, while Bayraktar and Wang [2] analysed the convergence of equilibria in N -player\ngames toward a mean-field game equilibrium in a discrete-time Markov decision game with non-exponential discounting.\n\n2\n\n\fIn this paper, we develop a general framework for non-cooperative stochast"

              "content": "ed with mean\u2013variance preferences, Basak and Chabakauri [1] were among the first to apply and extend the consistent\nplanning approach to mean\u2013variance portfolio optimisation, a research direction further advanced by Wang and Forsyth\n[64], Hu, Jin, and Zhou [38; 39], Wei, Wong, Yam, and Yung [65], He and Liang [30], Czichowsky [18], Bensoussan,\nWong, Yam, and Yung [4], Bj\u00f6rk, Murgoci, and Zhou [5], Kronborg and Steffensen [46] and Djehiche and Huang [23].\nMean\u2013variance criteria have also been studied in insurance-related problems, as in Li, Rong, and Zhao [50] and Zeng, Li,\nand Gu [66]. It is also worth noting the works of Bj\u00f6rk, Khapko, and Murgoci [6; 7; 8] (see also Lindensj\u00f6 [51] and the\nsurvey by He and Zhou [33]), who developed a comprehensive framework for addressing a broad class of time-inconsistent\nstochastic control problems in continuous time within the Markovian setting. In the non-Markovian setting, Hern\u00e1ndez\nand Possama\u00ef [36] provided a rigorous proof of an extended dynamic programming principle and fully characterised the\ntime-inconsistent problem through a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs).\n\nIn a consistent-planning perspective, an agent optimises their decisions while accounting for intra-personal conflict, and\ntherefore by correctly anticipating the actions of their selves in the future. A strategy that resolves this internal dynamic\nis called an intra-personal equilibrium and it has been extensively studied in the literature. In discrete time, the notion of\nintra-personal equilibrium is widely agreed upon and provides a mathematical formulation of Strotz\u2019s ideas. However, in\ncontinuous time, several alternative definitions have been proposed to capture the subtleties of temporal consistency. The\nmost widely adopted formulation is the first-order approximation approach, known as weak intra-personal equilibrium\nand pioneered by [24]. However, this definition does not guarantee that the equilibrium corresponds to an optimum of the\npayoff function, as it may merely identify a stationary point, and consequently, the agent may still have an incentive to\ndeviate from a given weak equilibrium strategy. To overcome this limitation, Huang and Zhou [41] introduced the notion\nof strong intra-personal equilibrium in the context of an infinite-time stochastic control problem, where an agent controls\nthe generator of a time-homogeneous, continuous-time, finite-state Markov chain. He and Jiang [32] showed that strong\nequilibrium strategies do not always exist. Motivated by this non-existence result, they suggested the concept of regular\nintra-personal equilibrium, which they showed to be stronger than the weak intra-personal equilibrium, and provided a\nsufficient condition under which these two notions coincide. The notion of intra-personal equilibrium is extended to the\nnon-Markovian setting in [36], where it is defined as a strategy from which the agent has no incentive to deviate over a\nshort period of time unless such a deviation yields an incremental reward positively proportional to the duration of that\nperiod, resembling the definition of weak equilibrium in the Markovian setting.\n\nWhile the works discussed so far focus on time-inconsistent control problems involving a single agent, we are particularly\ninterested in extending the analysis to multiple interacting players, and ultimately in studying the continuum limit with\nmean-field interactions. When several players exhibit time-inconsistent preferences, the resulting analysis involves two\ninterdependent levels of strategic interaction. At the inter-personal level, each agent\u2019s control affects the objectives of\nthe others, leading to the classical notion of Nash equilibrium among players. At the intra-personal level, each agent\nfaces a dynamic game against their future selves, induced by their time-inconsistent objectives. Each sophisticated agent\ntherefore seeks a sub-game\u2013perfect Nash equilibrium, that is, a strategy that constitutes an intra-personal equilibrium\ninternally and a Nash equilibrium externally. Equivalently, a sub-game\u2013perfect Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium\nacross both levels simultaneously: no agent has an incentive to deviate given the strategies of the others (inter-personal\nequilibrium), and no temporal self of any agent wishes to deviate given the continuation of their own strategy (intra-\npersonal equilibrium). Despite its relevance, existing literature on time-inconsistent problems has primarily focused on the\nsingle-agent case. Only a few works consider the multi-agent setting, where two intertwined levels of strategic interaction\narise. In the context of time-inconsistent contract theory, Cetemen, Feng, and Urgun [14] studied a contracting problem\nin which the principal exhibits non-exponential discounting, while Hern\u00e1ndez and Possama\u00ef [37] analysed the case of\na time-inconsistent sophisticated agent whose reward is determined by the solution of a backward stochastic Volterra\nintegral eq"
