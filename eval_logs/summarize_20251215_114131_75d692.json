While children in this age range were able to complete\nall caretaking tasks, it is possible that younger children might find\nsome tasks more challenging, and older children might find them\ntrivial. Thus, robot caretaking tasks should consider the child\u2019s age,\nintegrating a set of age-appropriate caretaking tasks for primary\nusers and siblings in the household. Furthermore, families might\nbenefit from robot caretaking tasks that would allow them to par-\ntake in a shared activity, while allowing the child to lead the robot\ncare and require minimal help from parents.\n\nThe personalized robot care routines showed that different chil-\ndren might prefer taking care of the robot at different times of the\nday. To support sustained caretaking from children, robot caretak-\ning tasks should be designed to adapt to the child\u2019s routine, e.g.,\nby learning their preferences over time. For example, if a child\navoids taking care of the robot at night, the robot might prompt the\nchild to engage in caretaking activities at alternatives times of the\nday through verbal or nonverbal expressions or through explicit\nrequests (e.g., wanting to \u201cgo to bed,\u201d needing to be fed/charged,\nasking for a bedtime story). Similarly, in a household where children\nhave trouble getting ready for school in the morning, over time\nthe robot might reduce its requests in the morning and identify an\nalternative time of the day for care requests.\n\n5.2 Limitations and Future Work\nOur work has a number of limitations. Firstly, due to the COVID-19\npandemic, it was challenging to recruit in-person participants, as\nthe timeline of this study overlapped with steep increases in cases\nwithin our target demographic. It was also challenging to maintain\na balanced gender distribution and increase the sample size within\nour recruitment efforts. We acknowledge that our findings are\n\npreliminary and exploratory, and a study with a larger sample size\nis necessary to draw generalizable conclusions. However, we believe\nthat our design guidelines for future work can serve as the initial\ngroundwork for designing robot caretaking tasks for children.\n\nThe short-term interaction involved in our study limits our abil-\nity to generalize findings to long-term interactions. Our study only\nexplored possible robot caretaking scenarios and their short term ef-\nfects on children\u2019s robot perception and connection, and long-term\nstudies are necessary to understand how such care obligations can\nform sustained interactions "

In\nsum, these exploratory findings infer that children tend to feel more\ncomfortable and as if they are forming friendships when conducting\ncaretaking tasks designed to form social connections and closeness.\n\n5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nWe explored caretaking tasks that children might engage in with a\nsocial robot and how those tasks might affect their perceptions of\nthe robot. We found that children currently engage in caretaking\nactivities with pets and younger siblings and children would want\nto engage in caretaking activities in which they feed, protect, teach,\nand show affection toward a social robot. Our initial exploration\nrevealed some evidence that caretaking activities that focus on\nconnection-making with the robot better promote a sense of close-\nness, comfort, and friendship, whereas utility activities promote a\nsense that the robot is sociable and intelligent, possible because the\nrobot is seen as an independent agent that does not need caretaking\n[26]. These findings suggest that caretaking activities may serve as\nan effective mechanism to promote engagement with social robots\nand provide early evidence of the types of activities that may be\nmost conducive to connection making between a child and a robot.\nIn this section, we explore the nuances of these findings and their\n\n\fIDC \u201922, June 27\u201330, 2022, Braga, Portugal\n\nBengisu Cagiltay, Joseph Michaelis, Sarah Sebo, and Bilge Mutlu\n\nrelation to prior work, present design implications based on these\nfindings, and describe future work needed to address the limitations\nof the current preliminary study.\n\nCaretaking Tasks for Child-Robot Interactions.

In this work, we aim to better understand and explore the design space of caretaking activities with 10 children, aged 8--12 from eight families, involving an exploratory design session followed by a preliminary feasibility testing of robot caretaking activities. The design sessions provided insight into children's current caretaking tasks, how they would take care of a social robot, and how these new caretaking activities could be integrated into their daily routines. The feasibility study tested two different types of robot caretaking tasks, which we call connection and utility, and measured their short term effects on children's perceptions of and closeness to the social robot. We discuss the themes and present interaction design guidelines of robot caretaking activities for children.",

Firstly, due to the COVID-19\npandemic, it was challenging to recruit in-person participants, as\nthe timeline of this study overlapped with steep increases in cases\nwithin our target demographic. It was also challenging to maintain\na balanced gender distribution and increase the sample size within\nour recruitment efforts. We acknowledge that our findings are\n\npreliminary and exploratory, and a study with a larger sample size\nis necessary to draw generalizable conclusions. However, we believe\nthat our design guidelines for future work can serve as the initial\ngroundwork for designing robot caretaking tasks for children.\n\nThe short-term interaction involved in our study limits our abil-\nity to generalize findings to long-term interactions. Our study only\nexplored possible robot caretaking scenarios and their short term ef-\nfects on children\u2019s robot perception and connection, and long-term\nstudies are necessary to understand how such care obligations can\nform sustained interactions between children and robots. Future\nresearch should prototype autonomous support for robot caretak-\ning tasks to allow long-term field testing. Furthermore, children\u2019s\nroutines might also be shaped by external factors that were not a\nfocus of our exploratory study, for example parents\u2019 routines, which\nshould be taken into consideration when designing for in-home set-\ntings. Future prototypes can also integrate additional social features,\nsuch as verbal and non-verbal expressions and affective responses\nfor communication during caretaking. Some example scenarios\nmight include the robot (1) expressing \u201csleepiness\u201d around bedtime;\n(2) expressing \u201cdisgust\u201d when it has been a long time since its last\n\u201cbath/cleaning;\u201d (3) expressing \u201cjitters\u201d around the time of day when\nit usually is taken for a walk/exercise; (4) expressing its \u201cworries\u201d\nwhen it encounters a fear and asks for a hug and reassurance; and\n(5) the robot saying \u201cthank you, I really like it when you take care\nof me so well.\u201d Thes"

It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization.

              "content": "the circ-\nular  wall,  the  extremes  of  the  N-S  diameter  of \nthe  room  marked  the  points  where  the  circle  of \nlight  was  cast  at  noon  on  the  solstices.    Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019.
