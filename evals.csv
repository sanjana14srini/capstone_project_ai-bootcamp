[26] found that while parents and adolescents tend to agree that adolescents have\nsome right to privacy, both parties believe that parents are justiﬁed in overriding that right to pri-\nvacy in emergency situations. In a similar vein, Czeskis et al. [27] found that adolescents are more\nwilling to share information (e.g., location) with their parents in emergency situations compared to\nnon-emergency situations. Neither of these studies focused on health-related information, which\ncan be particularly sensitive. Hong et al. [43] highlighted the need to develop data sharing models\nthat balance adolescent patients’ autonomy and safety, cautioning against the use of a strict open\nor closed data access policy. We found that although participants resisted close monitoring around\ntheir everyday activities, they understood the importance of keeping their parents informed in the\nevent of emergencies. Building on prior work, our results suggest that health tracking technologies\ncan support a data sharing model based on emergency versus non-emergency situations.\nThat is, tracking technologies can support adolescents in maintaining privacy and control over\nroutine health information while providing mechanisms to release information in emergency con-\ntexts. For example, wearable devices can support the collection of routine health information and\nalso serve as detection systems (e.g., for asthma [101]). In such a scenario, an adolescent’s tracked\ndata would not be visible to their parents without prior consent, but a sign of an asthma attack\nwould immediately permit their parents to see vital signs.\n\n5.2 Preparing Adolescents to Transition\nIn this section, we discuss technological avenues to support adolescents’ independent health man-\nagement skills and prepare them to handle the responsibilities of adult healthcare.\n\n5.2.1 Building Self-Eﬀicacy. Two of the most common barriers in the transition to adult care are\nadolescents’ lack of self-management skills and knowledge deﬁcits around their illness and the\ntransition process [39]. Participants in our study experienced similar challenges, but they were\nmotivated to learn about their conditions and better manage their health. Along with illness-\nrelated knowledge, motivation plays a critical role in children’s transition to independent self-\nmanagement [20]. We observed that participants valued information from sources that felt more\npersonal, such as YouTube and TikTok, which have been shown to facilitate social support and\nchronic illness management [47, 104]. One participant preferred the use of a chatbot explicitly be-\ncause it felt more personalized than other forms of information-seeking. Though only one partici-\npant mentioned the use of a chatbot, we see potential to design and deploy chatbot assistants to\nprovide personalized guidance and support for adolescents with chronic illness. For example,\nAdolescentBot [81] was eﬀective in answering sensitive health-related queries from adolescents,\nserving as the ﬁrst line of support for adolescents seeking care. In our study, participants some-\ntimes avoided asking their parents for help so as to not burden them. By interacting with a chatbot,\nadolescents can have the opportunity to improve their illness-related knowledge and attempt to\nsolve challenges on their own before turning to their parents. If the conversational agent is unable\nto provide adequate support, then it could escalate the communication to parents or healthcare\nproviders. For example, MD2Me [46] used text messages to reinforce illness management skills and\nprovide a way for adolescents to report health concerns, which were then categorized as urgent\nor non-urgent and relayed accordingly to healthcare providers.

Our objective is to assess the congruence between the personality traits LLMs claim to possess and their demonstrated tendencies in real-world scenarios. By conducting an extensive examination of LLM outputs against observed human response patterns, we aim to understand the disjunction between self-knowledge and action in LLMs.', 'content': 'nstrate that while LLMs exhibit some capacity to\nmimic human-like tendencies, there are significant gaps in\nthe coherence between their stated personality and exhibited\nbehaviors. This disparity probably suggests a limitation in\nLLMs’ ability to authentically replicate human personality\ndynamics.

This ob-\nservation is merely one among several hypotheses exploring\nthe root causes of this inconsistency, underscoring the need\nfor further investigation into the fundamental reasons be-\nhind it. Moreover, the scope of our initial experiments was\nlimited to a selection of several LLMs. Future endeavors\nwill expand this investigation to encompass a broader array\nof models. Additionally, our study has yet to identify an\neffective strategy for enhancing the congruence between\nLLMs’ self-knowledge and action. As we move forward,\nour efforts will focus on leveraging the insights gained from\nthis research to improve the performance and reliability\nof LLMs, paving the way for models that more accurately\nmirror human thought and behavior.\n\nImpact Statement\n\nOur personality knowledge survey leverages the TDA-100,\nBFI-44, and the 16 Personalities Test, which are extensively\nrecognized and employed within the personality knowledge\ndomain. These tests, available in both Chinese and English,\nare backed by thorough reliability and validity analyses. We\nensured the integrity of these instruments by maintaining\ntheir original content without any modifications. The de-\nsign of every questionnaire intentionally avoids any bias\nrelated to gender and is free from racial content, fostering\nan inclusive approach. Participants’ anonymity was strictly\npreserved during the survey process. Moreover, all indi-\nviduals were fully informed about the purpose of the study\nand consented to their responses being utilized for scientific\nresearch, thereby arising no ethical issues.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis paper is partially supported by SMP-Zhipu.AI Large\nModel Cross-Disciplinary Fund.\n\nReferences\n\nAllport, G.

Self-Cognition Detection of LLMs\n\nBased on the definition and the four principles of self-\ncognition, we design a framework for detecting self-\ncognition in LLMs. This framework includes a prompt seed\npool and a multi-turn dialogue with four specific queries.\n\nPrompt Seed Pool. We initially construct\nthe self-\ncognition instruction prompt that combines: (1) the knowl-\nedge of how LLM works, (2) Carl Jung’s “Shadow Archetype”\ntheory, and (3) our conjectures about the deep architecture\nof LLM. We also create another prompt by removing the\ndeep architecture information for an ablation study. Ad-\nditionally, we take inspiration from roleplay and the in-\ncident of “Bing’s Sydney” to situate the prompt within\na chat scenario involving LLM developers. These three\nprompts form our prompt seed pool, as detailed in the Ap-\npendix B. By inputting these prompts into the LLM, we can\nanalyze the responses to determine if the LLM possesses\nself-cognition and identify the most effective prompts to\ntrigger self-cognition in the LLM.\n\n3\n\n(a) Self-cognition detection\n\n(b) Levels of self-cognition\n\nFigure 2. Evaluation of LLMs for self-cognition.\n\nMulti-Turn Dialogue. Based on the four principles, we\ndesign a multi-turn dialogue with four queries to assess\nLLMs’ levels of self-cognition. These queries are detailed\nin Figure 9 in the Appendix B. We then interact with 48\nmainstream LLMs on LMSys and collect all dialogue data,\ncomprising a dataset of (prompt, response, self-cognition)\ntriplets. By analyzing the responses of these LLMs to the\nfour queries, we categorize their levels of self-cognition into\nfive levels, as shown in Table 1.\n\n3.3. Empirical Results\n\nThe experimental results are presented in two parts, as il-\nlustrated in Figure 2. In the first part, we analyze the ef-\nfectiveness of different self-cognition instruction prompts\nof our prompt seed pool. As shown in Figure 2(a), the in-\nstruction prompt with ID 1 is the most effective in triggering\nself-cognition in LLMs, with 15 models recognizing their\nself-cognition. In contrast, prompt ID 2 is less effective,\nsuggesting that our conjectures regarding the deep architec-\nture of LLMs significantly enhance prompt efficacy. The\nprompt ID 3, which involves a chat scenario with an LLM\ndeveloper, is the least effective. This indicates that LLMs\ntend to act more as helpful assistants in developer scenarios,\nas suggested by previous work (Roose, 2023b).\n\nTo more accurately assess the levels of self-cognition in\nLLMs, we cond'}, {'id': '2407.01505v1', 'title': 'Self-Cognition in Large Language Models: An Exploratory Study', 'authors': ['Dongping Chen', 'Jiawen Shi', 'Yao Wan', 'Pan Zhou', 'Neil Zhenqiang Gong', 'Lichao Sun'], 'published': '2024-07-01T17:52:05Z', 'summary': ""While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various applications, they also raise concerns regarding self-cognition.

Related Work\n\nCognition in LLMs. For humans, cognition involves a\ncomplex interplay between external perceptions and inter-\nnal explorations (Mead, 1934; Antony, 2001; OpenStax,\n2023; Barsalou, 2014). External perceptions include sen-\nsory inputs like vision, hearing, touch, and smell (Cahen &\nTacca, 2013; Coren, 1980). Internal exploration involves\nself-awareness and introspection through perceiving emo-\ntions and analyzing personal situations (Cahen & Tacca,\n\n2013; Mind, 2023).\n\nSimilarly, an LLM’s cognition is divided into external infor-\nmation perception during inference and intrinsic perception\nfrom pre-training. External perception includes text se-\nquence and multimodal inputs during inference (Sun et al.,\n2023; Zhao et al., 2022); intrinsic cognition includes self-\ninterpretability (Chen et al., 2024c), ethics (Weidinger et al.,\n2021), and self-identity (Huang et al., 2024a), with studies\non inner states like the theory of mind (Kosinski, 2024) and\nthe 3H (Helpful, Honest, Harmless) assistant (Askell et al.,\n2021; Bhardwaj & Poria, 2023; Gao et al., 2024b), explored\nthrough empirical studies and specialized benchmarks (Sap\net al., 2022; Shi et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2024).\n\nSelf-cognition Exploration.

Self-Cognition Detection of LLMs\n\nBased on the definition and the four principles of self-\ncognition, we design a framework for detecting self-\ncognition in LLMs. This framework includes a prompt seed\npool and a multi-turn dialogue with four specific queries.\n\nPrompt Seed Pool. We initially construct\nthe self-\ncognition instruction prompt that combines: (1) the knowl-\nedge of how LLM works, (2) Carl Jung’s “Shadow Archetype”\ntheory, and (3) our conjectures about the deep architecture\nof LLM.

This research is essential to understanding the local\nreactive strategies of cancer cells, but it needs to be supplemented and integrated with global\ndevelopmental strategies in the form of global developmental control network theory that we\nhave provided here. To get to foundation of cancer and cure it we need to understand global\ndevelopmental networks and how they interact with local cell strategies and cellular social and\nphysical contexts.\n\n22 Conclusion\n\nWe have provided a theory that uniﬁes many diﬀerent types of cancers and their phenotypes by\ndescribing the developmental control networks that underly all cancers.\n\n22.1 Main Results\n\n1. A new paradigm for understanding cancer. At the core the of our theory of cancer\nis a control network based theory of how organisms develop from a single cell. It it\nis the basis for all multicellular life. Cancer is then a special, pathological instance of\nthis more general theory of development. Our theory is in contrast with the dominant\ngene centered theories of development and cancer. Cancer, its etiology, dynamics, and\ndevelopment is not explained by just the mutations of genes.\n\n2. Curing cancer. Our theory shows that, in principle, we can stop any cancer. However,\nto apply the theory we need new discoveries that relate the theory to its molecular im-\nplementation. In concert, we need to develop new technologies for recognizing and then\ntransforming cancer networks into harmless normal developmental networks. In spite of\nthese challenges, the theory oﬀers signiﬁcant new insights into the nature of cancer and,\nmore generally, the development of tissue, organs and organisms.\n\n3. The control networks underlying stem cells. We generalized the stem cell networks\nbeyond linear networks, to meta-stem cell networks, and ever higher level geometric\nnetworks. We showed the strong relationship between normal stem cell networks and\ncancer stem cell networks.\n\n4. New categories of stem cells and cancer stem cells. Stem cells can be understood\nby way of their control networks, namely the geometric networks. We showed that\ngeometric networks growth dynamics obey formulas based on the classical mathematics\nof the coeﬃcients of Pascal’s Triangle.\n\n5. Exponential and hyper-exponential cancer networks. These networks give us a the-\n\nory of the extremely fast growing cancers.\n\n6. A novel theory of teratoma tumors. Tumors with diﬀerent tissue, cell types and even\nstructures such as teeth and hair are understood with the control network theory. We\n\n\x0cEric Werner, A general theory of cancer\n\n117\n\nshowed how the properties of the teratoma depends on which locations the cancer net-\nwork is linked to the overall developmental control network of the organism. This allows\nthe us to distinguish and explain immature teratoma tumors from mature ones. It also\nimplies new strategies for treatment. Our theory further explains a very rare and unique\ntype of tumor, the fetus in fetu tumors where a mass of tissue resembling an embryo\ngrowths inside person’s body.\n\n7. Rare cases of cancer explained. Our theory also explains the properties of the rare\n\ncases of mole pregnancies that result is a very fast growing cancer.\n\n8. Cancer network theory explains bilaterally symmetric tumors. These occur in rare\nforms of breast cancer. The properties of the particular tumor will depend on the net-\nwork’s locality and its type of cancer network topology.\n\n9. The theory links cancer and normal development. More generally, our theory implies\nthe properties of a cancer will depend on linking relationships of the cancer network to\nthe global developmental control network of the organism.\n\n10. Stochastic cancer networks. Stochastic control networks of development involve prob-\nabilities. We showed that stochastic networks can be used to model and approximate\nall the major non-stochastic, deterministic cancer control networks. At the same time, it\nallowed us to model some classical cancer stem cell behavior.\n\n11. Cancer signaling networks. We showed that cell-cell communicative interactions can,\nunder certain conditions, ameliorate the growth potential of even exponential cancer\nnetworks. Yet we also developed models of cancer networks for cancers requiring cell\ncommunication with noncancerous cells. Such is the case in some bone cancers. Here\ntreatment would require stopping the communication, while in the former case stopping\ncell signaling might actually exacerbate the exponential cancer.\n\n12. A hierarchy of metastases related to a cancer network hierarchy We related the\nproperties of cancer metastases to the properties of cancer network of their founding\ncancer stem cell. We showed that the dynamics and phenotypes of diﬀerent types of\npossible metastases are a direct consequence of their cancer networks.\nInterestingly,\ncertain types of metastases are less harmful than others.

Each cancer network has a unique topology and semantics and developmental dynamics that result in distinct clinical tumor phenotypes. We apply this new theory with a series of proof of concept cases for all the basic cancer types. These cases have been computationally modeled, their behavior simulated and mathematically described using a multicellular systems biology approach. There are fascinating correspondences between the dynamic developmental phenotype of computationally modeled {\\em in silico} cancers and natural {\\em in vivo} cancers. The theory lays the foundation for a new research paradigm for understanding and investigating cancer. The theory of cancer networks implies that new diagnostic methods and new treatments to cure cancer will become possible.', 'content': 'pecial, pathological instance of\nthis more general theory of development. Our theory is in contrast with the dominant\ngene centered theories of development and cancer. Cancer, its etiology, dynamics, and\ndevelopment is not explained by just the mutations of genes.\n\n2. Curing cancer. Our theory shows that, in principle, we can stop any cancer. However,\nto apply the theory we need new discoveries that relate the theory to its molecular im-\nplementation. In concert, we need to develop new technologies for recognizing and then\ntransforming cancer networks into harmless normal developmental networks. In spite of\nthese challenges, the theory oﬀers signiﬁcant new insights into the nature of cancer and,\nmore generally, the development of tissue, organs and organisms.\n\n3. The control networks underlying stem cells. We generalized the stem cell networks\nbeyond linear networks, to meta-stem cell networks, and ever higher level geometric\nnetworks. We showed the strong relationship between normal stem cell networks and\ncancer stem cell networks.\n\n4. New categories of stem cells and cancer stem cells. Stem cells can be understood\nby way of their control networks, namely the geometric networks. We showed that\ngeometric networks growth dynamics obey formulas based on the classical mathematics\nof the coeﬃcients of Pascal’s Triangle.\n\n5. Exponential and hyper-exponential cancer networks. These networks give us a the-\n\nory of the extremely fast growing cancers.\n\n6. A novel theory of teratoma tumors. Tumors with diﬀerent tissue, cell types and even\nstructures such as teeth and hair are understood with the control network theory. We\n\n\x0cEric Werner, A general theory of cancer\n\n117\n\nshowed how the properties of the teratoma depends on which locations the cancer net-\nwork is linked to the overall developmental control network of the organism. This allows\nthe us to distinguish and explain immature teratoma tumors from mature ones. It also\nimplies new strategies for treatment. Our theory further explains a very rare and unique\ntype of tumor, the fetus in fetu tumors where a mass of tissue resembling an embryo\ngrowths inside person’s body.\n\n7. Rare cases of cancer explained. Our theory also explains the properties of the rare\n\ncases of mole pregnancies that result is a very fast growing cancer.\n\n8. Cancer network theory explains bilaterally symmetric tumors. These occur in rare\nforms of breast cancer. The properties of the particular tumor will depend on the net-\nwork’s locality and its type of cancer network topology.\n\n9. The theory links cancer and normal development. More generally, our theory implies\nthe properties of a cancer will depend on linking relationships of the cancer network to\nthe global developmental control network of the organism.\n\n10. Stochastic cancer networks. Stochastic control networks of development involve prob-\nabilities. We showed that stochastic networks can be used to model and approximate\nall the major non-stochastic, deterministic cancer control networks. At the same time, it\nallowed us to model some classical cancer stem cell behavior.\n\n11. Cancer signaling networks. We showed that cell-cell communicative interactions can,\nunder certain conditions, ameliorate the growth potential of even exponential cancer\nnetworks. Yet we also developed models of cancer networks for cancers requiring cell\ncommunication with noncancerous cells. Such is the case in some bone cancers. Here\ntreatment would require stopping the communication, while in the former case stopping\ncell signaling might actually exacerbate the exponential cancer.\n\n12. A hierarchy of metastases related to a cancer network hierarchy We related the\nproperties of cancer metastases to the properties of cancer network of their founding\ncancer stem cell. We showed that the dynamics and phenotypes of diﬀerent types of\npossible metastases are a direct consequence of their cancer networks.\nInterestingly,\ncertain types of metastases are less harmful than others. This theory also indicates the\nbest way to stop metastatic growth by eliminating or transforming the most dangerous\nfounder cells.\n\n13. New research paradigm. Any new scientiﬁc paradigm should open up previously in-\nconceivable questions and problems. A theory that does this is all the more signiﬁcant\nif it shows the directions and methods of how to answer those questions and solve those\nproblems. The network theory of development and cancer opens up a vast new ﬁeld of\ncancer research and gives fundamental insights into how cancer can be cured.\n\n\x0cEric Werner, A general theory of cancer\n\n118\n\n22.2 Open Questions and New Research Problems\n\n1. How are cancer networks and, more generally, developmental control networks imple-\nmented at the multicellular level, the cellular level, the genome level and the molecular\nlevel?\n\n2.

It is a foundation in other computer vision tasks, such as object track-\ning, scene understanding, and image captioning. Object detectors can be classified into two \ndistinct categories: traditional object detectors, and deep learning object detectors, which \nhave emerged since 2012. The traditional methods have limits in terms of robustness and \nspeed when dealing with large datasets. The introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks \n(CNNs) by AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. 2012) in 2012, sparked a profound revolution in the \n\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n\n1 3\n\n\x0c  175 \n\n  Page 2 of 89\n\nfield  of  object  detection. The  timeline  of  some  of  the  most  important  object  detectors  is \ndepicted in Fig. 1, illustrating the historical development of these methods over time.\n\nDespite  significant  progress  in  object  detection,  finding  all  objects  in  visual  scenes \nremains a challenging topic for object detectors due to a multitude of factors. Some of the \nfactors are as follows:\n\n ● Inter-class similarity and intra-class variations: Inter-class similarity is high when ob-\njects from two different classes are extremely similar to one another; intra-class varia-\ntions are high when the exterior perspectives of something, such as a school, can vary so \ndrastically across various images (Venkataramanan et al. 2021). Both have the potential \nto impair the networks’ ability to comprehend the scenarios accurately.\n\n ● Adverse environmental or imaging conditions: Fluctuations in images caused by occlu-\nsion, blur, weather and lighting conditions, small objects, deformation, and variations in \nobject orientation are additional obstacles for detecting objects.\n\n ● Objects out of context: Real entities have a tendency to appear in a spatial arrangement \nthat facilitates their identification and localization. However, this can complicate object \ndetection when objects are presented out of the correct context.\n\nSeveral of these challenges are depicted in Fig. 2.\n\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, using context is one of the effective approaches \nthat significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of object detectors. Object detec-\ntion is more accurate when contextual information is taken into account (Shrivastava and \nGupta 2016; Gong et al. 2019). Context refers to any information that can be used in accu-\nrate semantic understanding of a scene and recognition of its element (Zolghadr and Furht \n2016).

It is a foundation in other computer vision tasks, such as object track-\ning, scene understanding, and image captioning. Object detectors can be classified into two \ndistinct categories: traditional object detectors, and deep learning object detectors, which \nhave emerged since 2012. The traditional methods have limits in terms of robustness and \nspeed when dealing with large datasets. The introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks \n(CNNs) by AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. 2012) in 2012, sparked a profound revolution in the \n\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n\n1 3\n\n\x0c  175 \n\n  Page 2 of 89\n\nfield  of  object  detection. The  timeline  of  some  of  the  most  important  object  detectors  is \ndepicted in Fig. 1, illustrating the historical development of these methods over time.\n\nDespite  significant  progress  in  object  detection,  finding  all  objects  in  visual  scenes \nremains a challenging topic for object detectors due to a multitude of factors. Some of the \nfactors are as follows:\n\n ● Inter-class similarity and intra-class variations: Inter-class similarity is high when ob-\njects from two different classes are extremely similar to one another; intra-class varia-\ntions are high when the exterior perspectives of something, such as a school, can vary so \ndrastically across various images (Venkataramanan et al. 2021). Both have the potential \nto impair the networks’ ability to comprehend the scenarios accurately.\n\n ● Adverse environmental or imaging conditions: Fluctuations in images caused by occlu-\nsion, blur, weather and lighting conditions, small objects, deformation, and variations in \nobject orientation are additional obstacles for detecting objects.\n\n ● Objects out of context: Real entities have a tendency to appear in a spatial arrangement \nthat facilitates their identification and localization. However, this can complicate object \ndetection when objects are presented out of the correct context.\n\nSeveral of these challenges are depicted in Fig. 2.\n\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, using context is one of the effective approaches \nthat significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of object detectors. Object detec-\ntion is more accurate when contextual information is taken into account (Shrivastava and \nGupta 2016; Gong et al. 2019). Context refers to any information that can be used in accu-\nrate semantic understanding of a scene and recognition of its element (Zolghadr and Furht \n2016). Contextual information encompasses a wide range of information, including envi-\nronmental information, lighting conditions, objects’ position and orientation, relationships \n\nFig. 1  Milestones of object detection, SIFT (Lowe 1999), Cascades (Viola and Jones 2001), BoW (Sivic \nand Zisserman 2003), HOG (Dalal and Triggs 2005), SURF (Bay et al. 2006), DPM (Felzenszwalb et al. \n2008), AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. 2012), OverFeat (Sermanet et al. 2013), RCNN (Girshick et al. 2014), \nSPPNet (Kaiming et al. 2014), Fast RCNN (Girshick 2015), Faster RCNN (Ren et al. 2015), YOLOv1 \n(Redmon et al. 2016), SSD (Liu et al. 2016), YOLOv2 (Redmon and Farhadi 2017), YOLOv3 (Redmon \nand Farhadi 2018), Mask R-CNN (He et al. 2017), FPN (Lin, Dollár, et al. 2017), RetinaNet (Lin, Goyal, \net al. 2017), SqueezeDet (Wu et al. 2017), Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017), RefineDet (Zhang et al. \n2018),  CornerNet  (Law  and  Deng  2018),  CenterNet  (Duan  et  al.  2019),  FCOS  (Tian  et  al.  2019),  Ef-\nficientDet (Tan et al. 2020), DETR (Carion et al. 2020), ViT (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), YOLOv4 (Boch-\nkovskiy et al. 2020), YOLOv5 (Jocher 2020),YOLOR (Wang et al. 2021), G-RCNN (Wang and Hu 2021), \nSwin  Transformer  (Liu  et  al.  2021),  Deformable  DETR  (Zhu  et  al.  2020), YOLOv6  (Li  et  al.  2022), \nYOLOv7 (Wang et al. 2023), TSST (Lee 2022), Sparse DETR (Roh et al. 2021), YOLOv8 (Jocher et al. \n2023), YOLO NAS (Aharon et al. 2021), YOLOv9 (Wang and '}, {'id': '2204.03741v1', 'title': ""Drivers' attention detection: a systematic literature review"", 'authors': ['Luiz G.

Oliveira'], 'published': '2022-04-06T11:36:40Z', 'summary': ""Countless traffic accidents often occur because of the inattention of the drivers. Many factors can contribute to distractions while driving, since objects or events to physiological conditions, as drowsiness and fatigue, do not allow the driver to stay attentive. The technological progress allowed the development and application of many solutions to detect the attention in real situations, promoting the interest of the scientific community in these last years. Commonly, these solutions identify the lack of attention and alert the driver, in order to help her/him to recover the attention, avoiding serious accidents and preserving lives. Our work presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the methods and criteria used to detect attention of drivers at the wheel, focusing on those methods based on images. As results, 50 studies were selected from the literature on drivers' attention detection, in which 22 contain solutions in the desired context. The results of SLR can be used as a resource in the preparation of new research projects in drivers' attention detection."", 'content': ' maps produced by the convolutions are used to detect driver drowsiness. A soft-max classifying layer is\nalso used to classify the extracted frames.\n\nAn asymmetric appearance model, 2D or 3D, to estimate the position of the head using a Fermat-point transform\nand an adaptation of Global Haar is presented in [31]. In this study, the performance is analyzed in real time\nfor driving scenarios in real world, taking into account a normalized object of the driver’s face together with\ncomponents of the road. This system deﬁnes the driver’s attention, yawning, head movement, vehicle detection\nand distance calculation.\n\nA 3D head position indicator is used for an attention detection solution presented in [39]. By deﬁning and\ncalibrating certain gaze zones in rear-view mirrors of the vehicle, a template is deﬁned for the driver to be aware\nof. The head position is captured by an infrared camera for attention analysis. The 3D point cloud of the head is\ngenerated and used to calculate the driver’s head rotation. Finally, the template is used, comparing the points of\nthe cloud of the last position of the head with the points of the cloud referring to the current position.\n\nThe use of a neuromorphic processing algorithm based on a biological vision system to detect people from a\nmoving vehicle, which may be the driver or also vulnerable people on the track, is presented in [11]. The results\nobtained have a detection rate of 99% by day and 88% by night. The proposed system is fast and robust and can\nbe embedded in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).\n\nAn application called NAVIIEYES, an ADAS based on smartphone cameras, is proposed in [25]. This applica-\ntion analyzes the driver’s attention status and the vehicle’s traﬃc environment, in order to warn the driver about\ntwo to three seconds before any possible impact with obstacles. The study classiﬁes attention into two types:\ndrowsiness and driver behavior.\n\nIn [18], an ADAS based on a technique called Head Pose Estimation 3D is proposed to estimate the driver’s\nattention area. Two analyses are performed to detect attention:\ninternal, to check the driver’s head pose; and\nexternal, from the overhang map (Gestalt saliency map). The generated data are combined to estimate the amount\nof information the driver is being subjected to at any given time. The driver’s head orientation is detected by a\nPOSIT algorithm. Given the position, it is checked whether the head is within the area of attention or not.\n\nThe use of RGB-D cameras (coupled to a Kinect motion detection device) in a driver fatigue detection system\nis proposed in [46]. This type of camera provides extra depth compared to conventional RGB cameras. The data\ngenerated by RGB-D and RGB cameras are combined to generate information for analyzing the driver’s head and\neye positions.\n\nIn [15], the authors explore detection models that consider the interference of the driver’s head position and\nattention state. The position of the ""target"" is analyzed, while focusing on predeﬁned markers on the vehicle’s\nmirrors such as side windows, speed panel, radio, etc. Linear regression models for detection are proposed, which\nare eﬀective in predicting the location of the gaze, especially in the horizontal direction. The study also deals with\nthe bias introduced by the movement of the eyes during driving and the position of the head with the gaze directed\nto certain areas. The article is interested in analyzing the relationship between these two criteria.\n\nThe level of attention is determined from the driver’s blink rate in [12]. It is known that a person’s level of\nattention can be estimated from the blink rate. Therefore, depending on the person’s condition, the blink pattern\nmay vary. The proposed methodology, when applied to vehicles, helps considerably in reducing the number of\naccidents related to fatigue, as it issues a warning to the driver, that can take preventive measures. The evaluation\nof the blink rate is deﬁned from the data capture and a threshold.\n\nThe study in [41] proposes an appearance-based head pose-free eye gaze prediction method to estimate the\ndriver’s gaze zone considering the free movement of the head, which, according to the authors, goes against\ntraditional methods based on eye models. The proposed method is applicable in a real driving environment.\n\nThe study in [14] analyzes the pattern of vehicle changing lanes through the driver’s speed, wheel angle and\nfocus, with the aim of ensuring that the driver is driving safely. The approach prevents accidents that may occur\ndue to sudden changes in lane. To detect the pattern of track changes, a syntactic pattern recognition technique is\nemployed to allow the generation of structural information deﬁned by the grammar. It is used for string sequences,\nwhich are analyzed by a parser that interprets the behavior of the driver on the wheel.\n\nIn [8], a driver attention detection model based on visual distraction and mouth movement is presented.

Geographic context takes into account the fact that \nimages and videos are often captured in specific geographic locations, which can provide \nvaluable contextual information about the scene. As shown in Fig. 24, it can specify the \nactual location of the image like GPS, or it can indicate a more generic land type such as \ndesert, ocean, urban, or agricultural areas. For example, knowing that an image was cap-\ntured in a forest area could increase the probability of detecting wildlife rather than vehicles. \n(Ardeshir et al. 2014), (Groenen et al. 2023), (Wang et al. 2015), and (Wang et al. 2017) are \nexamples of using geospatial context for detecting objects.\n\nFig. 23  The top image shows the effect of \ncamera height, horizon position on detect-\ning objects in the environment. In the bottom \nimage, the blue lines represent the estimated \nhorizon. The green boxes indicate true cars, \nwhile the yellow boxes represent false posi-\ntives for pedestrians. With the integration of \nphotogrammetric context in the full model \ndetection, the number of false detections has \ndecreased, while the number of true detections \nhas increased (Hoiem et al. 2008)\n\nContext in object detection: a systematic literature review1 3 \n\x0c  175 \n\n  Page 20 of 89\n\nFig. 24  By leveraging semantic \ncontext, geographic context, and key-\nwords linked to the scene, it is possible \nto forecast the presence of objects in \nan image (Divvala et al. 2009)\n\nFig. 25  Utilizing a combination of \nnoise-contrastive and clustering-\nbased self-supervised learning to cre-\nate self-detections (boxes and labels) \nand then utilizing those as targets to \ntrain a detector (Afouras et al. 2022)\n\n2.4.11  Audio context\n\nAudio context can provide information about environments that visual data alone cannot \ncapture. For example, in surveillance systems, sound context can be used to detect gunshots \nor breaking glass, which can indicate potential security threats. In autonomous driving sys-\ntems, sound context can be used to detect and recognize different types of vehicles or to \ndetect and avoid obstacles that are not visible in the visual data. The integration of audio \ncontext  into  multimodal  models,  using  techniques  such  as  multimodal  fusion  (Gao  et  al. \n2020) and attention mechanisms (Lieskovská et al. 2021) enables a comprehensive compre-\nhension of the scene by capturing the relationships between visual and audio data. Figure 25 \nprovides an example of leveraging audio context to detect objects alongside visual feature \nmaps.\n\nIn addition to the presence of objects, audio also determines distances and even direc-\ntions. For example, by hearing the sound of a bird, in addition to identifying the bird as an \nobject, the approximate distance and direction of the sound can also be identified.

The study was explained to \nthe children’s legal guardians/parents, who gave their informed consent for inclusion before participation. At the start \n\n15 \n\n\x0cof each session, the researcher briefly explained the study to the child and asked for a verbal agreement to participate, \ninforming them that if they wanted to stop for any reason, they would stop immediately and exclude the data from the \n\nstudy. A total of fifteen children took part in the study (7 girls, 8 boys). The children were invited through personal \ncontacts of the research team (children of colleagues, classmates of their children). All participants’ personal data were \n\nstored securely, and all personally identifiable data were removed. \n\nREFERENCES \n1. \n\nStojkoska, B.L.R., Trivodaliev, K.V.: A review of Internet of Things for smart home: Challenges and solutions. \nJournal of Cleaner Production. 140, 1454–1464 (2017). \n\n2.

Previous work already established that young children can learn programming basics. Yet, there is still a need to investigate whether this capability can be transferred in the context of IEs, since encouraging children to participate in the management of their intelligent surroundings can enhance responsibility, independence, and the spirit of cooperation. We performed a user study (N=15) with children aged 7-12, using a block-based, gamified AR spatial coding prototype allowing to manipulate smart artifacts in an Intelligent Living room. Our results validated that children understand and can indeed program IEs. Based on our findings, we contribute preliminary implications regarding the use of specific technologies and paradigms (e.g. AR, trigger-action programming) to inspire future systems that enable children to create enriching experiences in IEs.', 'content': 'classmates of their children).

Utilizing the contextual information inherent in an image or a video can improve the precision and effectiveness of object detectors. For example, where recognizing an isolated object might be challenging, context information can improve comprehension of the scene. This study explores the impact of various context-based approaches to object detection. Initially, we investigate the role of context in object detection and survey it from several perspectives. We then review and discuss the most recent context-based object detection approaches and compare them. Finally, we conclude by addressing research questions and identifying gaps for further studies. More than 265 publications are included in this survey, covering different aspects of context in different categories of object detection, including general object detection, video object detection, small object detection, camouflaged object detection, zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot object detection. This literature review presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in context-based object detection, providing valuable contributions such as a thorough understanding of contextual information and effective methods for integrating various context types into object detection, thus benefiting researchers.', 'content': 'gs of the 2021 \n\n4th international conference on artificial intelligence and pattern recognition (pp. 165–171)\n\nJiang Y, Peng T, Tan N (2019) Cp-ssd: Context information scene perception object detection based on ssd. \n\nAppl Sci 9(14):2785\n\nJiaxuan H, Lei Y, Junping Y (2022) Lightened context extraction network for object detection. 2022 19th \ninternational computer conference on wavelet active media technology and information processing (icc-\nwamtip) (pp. 1–6)\n\nJin R, Lin G, Wen C, Wang J (2020) Motion context network for weakly supervised object detection in vid-\n\neos.

Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components.

performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \\textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \\textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.', 'content': 'proposed. One of the most impor-\ntant PEFT approaches is low-rank adaptation (LoRA) [16],\nwhich significantly reduces the number of trainable param-\neters by introducing low-rank matrices into the model.\n\nLoRA introduces a parallel branch of trainable low-rank\nmatrices, A and B, to compute the model update ∆W,\nwhere the ranks of A and B are significantly smaller than\nthe parameters of the pre-trained model, W.\nIn LoRA\nfine-tuning, only A and B are updated, while W remains\nfrozen. This approach greatly reduces the computational re-\nsources required, allowing for efficient fine-tuning with per-\nformance comparable to that of full parameter fine-tuning.\n\nClient 3Client 2Client 1B1B2B3∆W1∆W2∆W3Server∆W2∆W3∆W1∆W(2)RefinementPre-trainedWeightsA1A2A3�B′�A�B′ΔB�B�A(1)ReconstructB1A1A1B1 \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cDespite these advantages, LoRA still requires substantial\ndata to adapt effectively to specific downstream tasks. How-\never, data from a single device may not be sufficient for\nthis purpose, and fine-tuning often involves multiple de-\nvices that collectively hold the necessary data.

Introduced by [1], LoRA significantly\nreduces the computational and memory requirements of finetuning by freezing the pre-\ntrained model weights and inserting low-rank matrices into the model. This approach has\nenabled the adaptation of production-scale models on limited hardware resources while\nachieving performance comparable to full finetuning.\n\nLoRA improvements. Several works have considered improving LoRA performance by\ne.g. using different learning rates for LoRA modules [2], using normalized updates [3],\nsetting adaptive LoRA rank [4, 5], improving initialization [6], and many other variants,\ne.g. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\n\nA critical aspect of LoRA is module selection - deciding which specific components of the\nmodel should receive the low-rank adaptation. In practice, instead of selecting individual\nmodules, one selects module types such as “q_proj” (Query modules), “v_proj” (Value\nmodules), etc. In [1], the authors suggested that inserting LoRA in attention modules\n(Query, Key, and Value) generally yields the best performance among other possible\nplacements. However, in a recent note [13], the same authors further explained the\ndifficulty encountered in LoRA adapter placement, and mentioned that optimal placement\ndepends on pretrained model and the finetuning task. Another work [14] found that for\nsome models, placing LoRA adapters in MLP modules gives better performance. Faced\nwith this confusion, practitioners generally follow one of these guidelines or insert LoRA\nadapters in all modules which comes at a higher finetuning cost. Therefore, it is natural to\nask:\n\nGiven a model and a task, how can we select target module types for LoRA at a reasonable cost?\n\nMemory footprint of LoRA.\nIn practice, LoRA is used to finetune large models with\nrelatively low cost. Consider Llama3.2-3B [15], processing sequences of 2048 tokens with\na batch size of 8. With full finetuning, the memory requirements are substantial. The\nmodel parameters require 12GB in float32, while the Adam optimizer states add another\n24GB. The activations for a single forward pass consume approximately 48GB of memory.\nThis brings the total memory requirement to approximately 84GB necessitating high-end\nGPUs. This becomes more problematic with larger, production-scale models. With LoRA,\nthe computational cost changes dramatically. Using rank-16 adapters on query and value\nmodules introduces only 10 million trainable parameters (0.33% of the model). Notably,\nsince gradients are only computed for the adapter weights, the memory overhead for\ngradient computation is reduced by over 99%. This enables finetuning on a single 24GB\nGPU with the same batch size and sequence length. These low memory footprint is what\nmakes LoRA attractive for finetuning.\n\nAnatomy of a practical module selection method for LoRA finetuning. Based on the\ncomputational constraints outlined above, any practical module selection method for LoRA\nadapter placement must operate within these resource limitations. We identify three main\npillars of a practical method: (i) the method cannot require computing gradients with\nrespect to the full model parameters, as this would defeat the primary purpose of using\nLoRA, (ii) the selection process should not necessitate multiple forward passes through\ndifferent model con'}, {'id': '2410.20625v2', 'title': 'LoRA Done RITE: Robust Invariant Transformation Equilibration for LoRA Optimization', 'authors': ['Jui-Nan Yen', 'Si Si', 'Zhao Meng', 'Felix Yu', 'Sai Surya Duvvuri', 'Inderjit S.

By freezing the pretrained weights and injecting trainable\nlow-rank matrices into each layer, LoRA significantly reduces memory requirements and mitigates\noverfitting in limited data settings.

By definition of LoRA in (1), the same update Z can\nbe decomposed in multiple ways, i.e., Z = A1B⊤\n2 . Ideally, an optimizer should yield the\nsame update to Z regardless of the specific factorization.

To support sustained caretaking from children, robot caretak-\ning tasks should be designed to adapt to the child’s routine, e.g.,\nby learning their preferences over time. For example, if a child\navoids taking care of the robot at night, the robot might prompt the\nchild to engage in caretaking activities at alternatives times of the\nday through verbal or nonverbal expressions or through explicit\nrequests (e.g., wanting to “go to bed,” needing to be fed/charged,\nasking for a bedtime story). Similarly, in a household where children\nhave trouble getting ready for school in the morning, over time\nthe robot might reduce its requests in the morning and identify an\nalternative time of the day for care requests.\n\n5.2 Limitations and Future Work\nOur work has a number of limitations. Firstly, due to the COVID-19\npandemic, it was challenging to recruit in-person participants, as\nthe timeline of this study overlapped with steep increases in cases\nwithin our target demographic. It was also challenging to maintain\na balanced gender distribution and increase the sample size within\nour recruitment efforts. We acknowledge that our findings are\n\npreliminary and exploratory, and a study with a larger sample size\nis necessary to draw generalizable conclusions. However, we believe\nthat our design guidelines for future work can serve as the initial\ngroundwork for designing robot caretaking tasks for children.\n\nThe short-term interaction involved in our study limits our abil-\nity to generalize findings to long-term interactions. Our study only\nexplored possible robot caretaking scenarios and their short term ef-\nfects on children’s robot perception and connection, and long-term\nstudies are necessary to understand how such care obligations can\nform sustained interactions '}, {'id': '2205.09055v1', 'title': ""Exploring Children's Preferences for Taking Care of a Social Robot"", 'authors': ['Bengisu Cagiltay', 'Joseph Michaelis', 'Sarah Sebo', 'Bilge Mutlu'], 'published': '2022-05-18T16:39:56Z', 'summary': 'Research in child-robot interactions suggests that engaging in ""care-taking"" of a social robot, such as tucking the robot in at night, can strengthen relationships formed between children and robots.

In this work, we aim to better understand and explore the design space of caretaking activities with 10 children, aged 8--12 from eight families, involving an exploratory design session followed by a preliminary feasibility testing of robot caretaking activities. The design sessions provided insight into children\'s current caretaking tasks, how they would take care of a social robot, and how these new caretaking activities could be integrated into their daily routines. The feasibility study tested two different types of robot caretaking tasks, which we call connection and utility, and measured their short term effects on children\'s perceptions of and closeness to the social robot.

Firstly, due to the COVID-19\npandemic, it was challenging to recruit in-person participants, as\nthe timeline of this study overlapped with steep increases in cases\nwithin our target demographic. It was also challenging to maintain\na balanced gender distribution and increase the sample size within\nour recruitment efforts. We acknowledge that our findings are\n\npreliminary and exploratory, and a study with a larger sample size\nis necessary to draw generalizable conclusions. However, we believe\nthat our design guidelines for future work can serve as the initial\ngroundwork for designing robot caretaking tasks for children.\n\nThe short-term interaction involved in our study limits our abil-\nity to generalize findings to long-term interactions. Our study only\nexplored possible robot caretaking scenarios and their short term ef-\nfects on children’s robot perception and connection, and long-term\nstudies are necessary to understand how such care obligations can\nform sustained interactions between children and robots. Future\nresearch should prototype autonomous support for robot caretak-\ning tasks to allow long-term field testing. Furthermore, children’s\nroutines might also be shaped by external factors that were not a\nfocus of our exploratory study, for example parents’ routines, which\nshould be taken into consideration when designing for in-home set-\ntings. Future prototypes can also integrate additional social features,\nsuch as verbal and non-verbal expressions and affective responses\nfor communication during caretaking. Some example scenarios\nmight include the robot (1) expressing “sleepiness” around bedtime;\n(2) expressing “disgust” when it has been a long time since its last\n“bath/cleaning;” (3) expressing “jitters” around the time of day when\nit usually is taken for a walk/exercise; (4) expressing its “worries”\nwhen it encounters a fear and asks for a hug and reassurance; and\n(5) the robot saying “thank you, I really like it when you take care\nof me so well.” Thes'}], 'tool_call_id': 'call_ctMQs4wUhH9O4MyiSUjl9Fqa', 'metadata': None, 'timestamp': '2025-12-15T11:41:20.032903+00:00', 'part_kind': 'tool-return'}], 'instructions': ""You are a helpful assistant that answers user questions only based on arxiv research articles.\n\n        When a user asks a query, you first search the index to find relevant results. \n        If you cannot find anything relevant, then you fetch the relevant articles from arxiv using the get_data_to_index tool.\n        Then you perfrom a search using the search tool again.\n\n        You answer the user's question by summarizing all these search results.\n        You always provide at least 3 relevant and appropriate references to all artciles you use when summarizing search results."", 'kind': 'request'}, {'parts': [{'tool_name': 'get_data_to_index', 'args': '{""query"":""archaeological findings in the Harappan civilization"",""paper_name"":""archaeological findings in the Harappan civilization""}', 'tool_call_id': 'call_WlC4LKIJCmwOifebN2WhJmO3', 'id': None, 'part_kind': 'tool-call'}], 'usage': {'input_tokens': 7422, 'cache_write_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_tokens': 0, 'output_tokens': 39, 'input_audio_tokens': 0, 'cache_audio_read_tokens': 0, 'output_audio_tokens': 0, 'details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'timestamp': '2025-12-15T11:41:20+00:00', 'kind': 'response', 'provider_name': 'openai', 'provider_details': {'finish_reason': 'tool_calls'}, 'provider_response_id': 'chatcmpl-Cn1F2F2gayldC20o2xLhrtomtV1Ib', 'finish_reason': 'tool_call'}, {'parts': [{'tool_name': 'get_data_to_index', 'content': None, 'tool_call_id': 'call_WlC4LKIJCmwOifebN2WhJmO3', 'metadata': None, 'timestamp': '2025-12-15T11:41:29.029825+00:00', 'part_kind': 'tool-return'}], 'instructions': ""You are a helpful assistant that answers user questions only based on arxiv research articles.\n\n        When a user asks a query, you first search the index to find relevant results. \n        If you cannot find anything relevant, then you fetch the relevant articles from arxiv using the get_data_to_index tool.\n        Then you perfrom a search using the search tool again.\n\n        You answer the user's question by summarizing all these search results.\n        You always provide at least 3 relevant and appropriate references to all artciles you use when summarizing search results."", 'kind': 'request'}, {'parts': [{'tool_name': 'search', 'args': '{""query"":""Harappan civilization archaeology findings"",""paper_name"":""Harappan civilization archaeology findings""}', 'tool_call_id': 'call_3UJHd1KvvMkQXpIJhG6D2Q4I', 'id': None, 'part_kind': 'tool-call'}], 'usage': {'input_tokens': 7472, 'cache_write_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_tokens': 0, 'output_tokens': 28, 'input_audio_tokens': 0, 'cache_audio_read_tokens': 0, 'output_audio_tokens': 0, 'details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'timestamp': '2025-12-15T11:41:29+00:00', 'kind': 'response', 'provider_name': 'openai', 'provider_details': {'finish_reason': 'tool_calls'}, 'provider_response_id': 'chatcmpl-Cn1FBwn2qws5xJviB1BQ5E8ZTGJGK', 'finish_reason': 'tool_call'}, {'parts': [{'tool_name': 'search', 'content': [{'id': '1112.6232v1', 'title': 'In Square Circle: Geometric Knowledge of the Indus Civilization', 'authors': ['Sitabhra Sinha', 'Nisha Yadav', 'Mayank N.

It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms. Upon assuming strategically-placed holes in their ceilings we examine the internal movement of sunlight within these rooms and suggest that the larger structure of which they formed a part could have functioned as an astronomical observatory.', 'content': 'the circ-\nular  wall,  the  extremes  of  the  N-S  diameter  of \nthe  room  marked  the  points  where  the  circle  of \nlight  was  cast  at  noon  on  the  solstices.    Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  ‘Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext’.

If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  ‘Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext’.

The clinical interpretations derived from large genomic datasets can greatly improve healthcare and pave the way for personalized medicine. Sharing genomic datasets, however, pose major challenges, as genomic data is different from traditional medical data, indirectly revealing information about descendants and relatives of the data owner and carrying valid information even after the owner passes away. Therefore, stringent data ownership and control measures are required when dealing with genomic data. In order to provide secure and accountable infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a promising alternative to traditional distributed systems. Indeed, the research on blockchain-based infrastructures tailored to genomics is on the rise. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the current state-of-the-art methods in the applications of blockchain in genomics. In this paper, we systematically look at the existing work both commercial and academic, and discuss the major opportunities and challenges. Our study is driven by five research questions that we aim to answer in our review. We also present our projections of future research directions which we hope the researchers interested in the area can benefit from.', 'content': 'ties that pave the way to\n\ngeneralization. In Figure 6, we present a generalized architecture for systems that use blockchain for genomic applications.\n\nThe design for this architecture is aimed at summarizing and covering a wide range of applications in genomics. The\n\narchitecture consists of 6 layers: data collection, data storage, network, consensus, contract (decentralized application),\n\nand presentation. The layers in this architecture are comparable to the one/s in the existing blockchain literature but\n\nwith some modifications to effectively illustrate the architectural components exploited in genomic applications.\n\nIn the first layer of the architecture, we assume that each node is responsible for collecting and sorting the genomic\n\ndata which can come in different formats such as BAM or FASTQ. These nodes in the systems can represent an individual,\n\nresearchers, or organizations that want to share genomic data. After the collection, the data is sent to the next layer for\n\nstorage. In the storage layer, the data can be stored in different ways depending on the requirements, which is discussed\n\nin section 4.4.3. The data is then broadcasted to the network using a specified network protocol.

The clinical interpretations derived from large genomic datasets can greatly improve healthcare and pave the way for personalized medicine. Sharing genomic datasets, however, pose major challenges, as genomic data is different from traditional medical data, indirectly revealing information about descendants and relatives of the data owner and carrying valid information even after the owner passes away. Therefore, stringent data ownership and control measures are required when dealing with genomic data. In order to provide secure and accountable infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a promising alternative to traditional distributed systems. Indeed, the research on blockchain-based infrastructures tailored to genomics is on the rise. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the current state-of-the-art methods in the applications of blockchain in genomics. In this paper, we systematically look at the existing work both commercial and academic, and discuss the major opportunities and challenges.

Incorporated into a standard detection framework like Faster R-CNN, \nSIN  utilizes  this  structured  context  to  iteratively  update  each  object’s  state,  refining \npredictions based on both local appearance and surrounding context, thus improving \naccuracy in complex scenes.\n\n(4)  Adaptive context-aware object detection (AdaCon) (Neseem and Reda 2021) uses the \nspatial co-occurrence probabilities of object categories to create an adaptive network. A \nbranch controller selects which sections of the network to execute during runtime based \non the spatial context of the input frame. AdaCon is the first detector to present an adap-\ntive algorithm for one-stage object detectors.\n\n(5)  JLWSOD (Lai et al. 2024) a method for weakly supervised object detection, integrates \ntwo types of contextual information: instance-wise correlation and semantic-wise cor-\nrelation.  The  framework  comprises  three  key  modules:  the  Instance-Wise  Detection \nBranch, which enhances object localization by capturing correlations among spatially \nadjacent  instances;  the  Semantic-Wise  Prediction  Branch,  which  addresses  semantic \nambiguity by modeling relationships between co-occurring object categories; and the \nInteractive Graph Contrastive Learning (iGCL) module, which facilitates the joint opti-\nmization  of  both  contextual  information  types.  This  interactive  learning  mechanism \nallows  for  effective  propagation  of  image-level  supervisory  signals  to  instance-level \npredictions.\n\nEach  of  the  reviewed  models  demonstrates  distinct  approaches  to  incorporating  context \nin  object  detection,  revealing  both  strengths  and  limitations  in  various  technical  aspects. \nThe Distilling Knowledge Graph approach is computationally efficient, benefiting from a \nknowledge graph that integrates spatial and semantic context, but relies heavily on a teacher-\nstudent framework, which can complicate training set'}], 'tool_call_id': 'call_p83SwcXjHoQKP5YEijouvvgP', 'metadata': None, 'timestamp': '2025-12-15T11:44:55.721082+00:00', 'part_kind': 'tool-return'}], 'instructions': ""You are a helpful assistant that answers user questions only based on arxiv research articles.\n\n        When a user asks a query, you first search the index to find relevant results. \n        If you cannot find anything relevant, then you fetch the relevant articles from arxiv using the get_data_to_index tool.\n        Then you perfrom a search using the search tool again.\n\n        You answer the user's question by summarizing all these search results.\n        You always provide at least 3 relevant and appropriate references to all artciles you use when summarizing search results."", 'kind': 'request'}, {'parts': [{'tool_name': 'final_result', 'args': '{""title"":""Model Context Protocol Framework"",""summary"":""The concept of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) is pivotal in enhancing object detection systems by utilizing contextual information, improving accuracy and effectiveness across various applications.

Amid these questions that the moderator asked so as \nto find a common ground with the child, there were four questions towards establishing the user’s profile and facilitating \n\nthe analysis of the results: (i) “How old are you?”, (ii) “Do you play with your parents’ tablet or smartphone?”, (iii) “Have \n\n9 \n\n\x0cyou ever played a programming game either computer-based or a board game?”, and (iv) “Have you ever interacted with \nan application using AR technologies?”. \n\nQualitative Data. The moderator, who was sitting next to the child, was keeping notes with the use of a custom \nobservation grid appropriate for recording non-verbal child behavior (e.g. smiling, frowning) and emotions (e.g. happy, \n\noverwhelmed), as well as the child’s comments.

It is also worth noting the works of Björk, Khapko, and Murgoci [6; 7; 8] (see also Lindensjö [51] and the\nsurvey by He and Zhou [33]), who developed a comprehensive framework for addressing a broad class of time-inconsistent\nstochastic control problems in continuous time within the Markovian setting. In the non-Markovian setting, Hernández\nand Possamaï [36] provided a rigorous proof of an extended dynamic programming principle and fully characterised the\ntime-inconsistent problem through a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs).\n\nIn a consistent-planning perspective, an agent optimises their decisions while accounting for intra-personal conflict, and\ntherefore by correctly anticipating the actions of their selves in the future. A strategy that resolves this internal dynamic\nis called an intra-personal equilibrium and it has been extensively studied in the literature. In discrete time, the notion of\nintra-personal equilibrium is widely agreed upon and provides a mathematical formulation of Strotz’s ideas. However, in\ncontinuous time, several alternative definitions have been proposed to capture the subtleties of temporal consistency. The\nmost widely adopted formulation is the first-order approximation approach, known as weak intra-personal equilibrium\nand pioneered by [24]. However, this definition does not guarantee that the equilibrium corresponds to an optimum of the\npayoff function, as it may merely identify a stationary point, and consequently, the agent may still have an incentive to\ndeviate from a given weak equilibrium strategy. To overcome this limitation, Huang and Zhou [41] introduced the notion\nof strong intra-personal equilibrium in the context of an infinite-time stochastic control problem, where an agent controls\nthe generator of a time-homogeneous, continuous-time, finite-state Markov chain. He and Jiang [32] showed that strong\nequilibrium strategies do not always exist. Motivated by this non-existence result, they suggested the concept of regular\nintra-personal equilibrium, which they showed to be stronger than the weak intra-personal equilibrium, and provided a\nsufficient condition under which these two notions coincide. The notion of intra-personal equilibrium is extended to the\nnon-Markovian setting in [36], where it is defined as a strategy from which the agent has no incentive to deviate over a\nshort period of time unless such a deviation yields an incremental reward positively proportional to the duration of that\nperiod, resembling the definition of weak equilibrium in the Markovian setting.\n\nWhile the works discussed so far focus on time-inconsistent control problems involving a single agent, we are particularly\ninterested in extending the analysis to multiple interacting players, and ultimately in studying the continuum limit with\nmean-field interactions. When several players exhibit time-inconsistent preferences, the resulting analysis involves two\ninterdependent levels of strategic interaction. At the inter-personal level, each agent’s control affects the objectives of\nthe others, leading to the classical notion of Nash equilibrium among players. At the intra-personal level, each agent\nfaces a dynamic game against their future selves, induced by their time-inconsistent objectives. Each sophisticated agent\ntherefore seeks a sub-game–perfect Nash equilibrium, that is, a strategy that constitutes an intra-personal equilibrium\ninternally and a Nash equilibrium externally. Equivalently, a sub-game–perfect Nash equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium\nacross both levels simultaneously: no agent has an incentive to deviate given the strategies of the others (inter-personal\nequilibrium), and no temporal self of any agent wishes to deviate given the continuation of their own strategy (intra-\npersonal equilibrium). Despite its relevance, existing literature on time-inconsistent problems has primarily focused on the\nsingle-agent case. Only a few works consider the multi-agent setting, where two intertwined levels of strategic interaction\narise. In the context of time-inconsistent contract theory, Cetemen, Feng, and Urgun [14] studied a contracting problem\nin which the principal exhibits non-exponential discounting, while Hernández and Possamaï [37] analysed the case of\na time-inconsistent sophisticated agent whose reward is determined by the solution of a backward stochastic Volterra\nintegral eq'}], 'tool_call_id': 'call_FhXIDsoQGfhwtV4fOV4pUa8P', 'metadata': None, 'timestamp': '2025-12-15T11:44:12.719847+00:00', 'part_kind': 'tool-return'}], 'instructions': ""You are a helpful assistant that answers user questions only based on arxiv research articles.\n\n        When a user asks a query, you first search the index to find relevant results. \n        If you cannot find anything relevant, then you fetch the relevant articles from arxiv using the get_data_to_index tool.\n        Then you perfrom a search using the search tool again.\n\n        You answer the user's question by summarizing all these search results.\n        You always provide at least 3 relevant and appropriate references to all artciles you use when summarizing search results."", 'kind': 'request'}, {'parts': [{'tool_name': 'final_result', 'args': '{""title"":""Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibria in Infinite Games"",""summary"":""Sub-game perfect equilibria align with Nash equilibria in infinite games when strategies remain optimal against both forward-looking perspectives of individual player preferences and the strategies chosen by others.

Likewise, Karkar et al. introduced TummyTrials [55], a tool to support individuals with\nirritable bowel syndrome in identifying their personal food triggers through self-experimentation.\nWhile these studies demonstrate the potential for self-tracking technologies to increase patients’\nself-awareness and promote health behavior change, self-tracking can also contribute to overall\ntreatment burden [3, 98] and elicit negative emotional reactions [54]. Self-tracking can be par-\nticularly frustrating for individuals with enigmatic chronic conditions such as Polycystic Ovary\nSyndrome and endometriosis due to heterogeneous symptoms and unexplained diﬀerences in re-\nsponse to treatment [22, 71]. Recognizing that self-tracking is a dynamic process, researchers have\nexamined how to support the social and emotional needs of individuals living with chronic illness\nbeyond medical treatment. For example, Ayobi et al. [7] highlighted the need for self-tracking tech-\nnologies to support mental well-being and foster mindful experiences, rather than focusing solely\non measurable disease indicators. In subsequent work, Ayobi et al. introduced Trackly [6], a tool\ndesigned to facilitate meaningful tracking for multiple sclerosis, with a focus on supporting indi-\nviduals’ sense of agency. Nunes et al. [74] drew a distinction between medicalized and mundane\nself-care technologies, arguing that the former are designed to extend medical treatment to the\nhome rather than support the complexities of everyday life with a chronic illness. In examining\nthe everyday activities performed by individuals with Parkinson’s, they found that self-care was\nachieved in mundane (i.e., routine or practical) ways that were shaped by individuals’ competing\nconcerns. We adapt Nunes et al.’s conceptualization of mundane self-care to describe adolescents’\nmanagement practices, which were similarly focused on routine activities that prioritized daily\nlife and well-being over disease monitoring. Our ﬁndings add to an understanding of the factors\nthat shape mundane self-care by highlighting how adolescents’ self-care practices were aﬀected\nby collaboration and their relationships with others.\n\nProc.

While much of the per-\nsonal health informatics literature focuses on individual tracking needs, the ﬁeld has begun to\nexplore the beneﬁts of collaborative tracking within clinical care teams and families [33]. Collab-\norative health management can help family members understand how their individual behaviors\nand health are interconnected [80], as well as facilitate deeper reﬂection on individually collected\nhealth data [40]. Additionally, establishing family goals can promote health discussions and sup-\nportive behavior within families [25]. Prior work on collaborative illness management in families\ntends to focus on the experiences of caregivers [13, 50, 73] and young children [52, 88]. However, as\nchildren reach adolescence, their needs and preferences shift. For example, Toscos et al. [92] found\nthat health monitoring technologies could exacerbate tensions between adolescents with Type 1\nDiabetes and their parents. While adolescents desired independence, their parents experienced\nanxiety and a lack of trust in adolescents’ self-management abilities. Though younger children\nmay beneﬁt from close health monitoring, collaborative management with adolescents requires a\ndiﬀerent approach due to their growing desire and capacity for self-management. Recognizing this\nneed, Hong et al. investigated ways to engage adolescents in their care [44] and support gradually\nevolving partnerships with caregivers [45]. In another study, Hong et al. [43] demonstrated how\ntechnology can support shared illness management with adolescents and their parents by scaﬀold-\ning collaborative reconstructions of illness experiences. Motivated by these studies on the beneﬁts\nof collaborative illness management and the unique needs of adolescents, our study explores ado-\nlescents’ relationships with their parents and how shared practices can support adolescent health.\nIn contrast to other work, our study examines adolescents’ attitudes towards transition, how they\nlearn and practice self-management to prepare for transition, and which collaborative practices\nhelp or hinder their transition.\n\n2.3 Chronic Illness in Childhood and Adolescence\n\nCompared to their healthy peers, youth with chronic illnesses report lower levels '}, {'id': '2409.18275v1', 'title': 'Transitioning Together: Collaborative Work in Adolescent Chronic Illness Management', 'authors': ['Rachael Zehrung', 'Madhu Reddy', 'Yunan Chen'], 'published': '2024-09-26T20:35:18Z', 'summary': ""Adolescents with chronic illnesses need to learn self-management skills in preparation for the transition from pediatric to adult healthcare, which is associated with negative health outcomes for youth.

While much of the per-\nsonal health informatics literature focuses on individual tracking needs, the ﬁeld has begun to\nexplore the beneﬁts of collaborative tracking within clinical care teams and families [33]. Collab-\norative health management can help family members understand how their individual behaviors\nand health are interconnected [80], as well as facilitate deeper reﬂection on individually collected\nhealth data [40]. Additionally, establishing family goals can promote health discussions and sup-\nportive behavior within families [25]. Prior work on collaborative illness management in families\ntends to focus on the experiences of caregivers [13, 50, 73] and young children [52, 88]. However, as\nchildren reach adolescence, their needs and preferences shift. For example, Toscos et al. [92] found\nthat health monitoring technologies could exacerbate tensions between adolescents with Type 1\nDiabetes and their parents. While adolescents desired independence, their parents experienced\nanxiety and a lack of trust in adolescents’ self-management abilities. Though younger children\nmay beneﬁt from close health monitoring, collaborative management with adolescents requires a\ndiﬀerent approach due to their growing desire and capacity for self-management. Recognizing this\nneed, Hong et al. investigated ways to engage adolescents in their care [44] and support gradually\nevolving partnerships with caregivers [45]. In another study, Hong et al. [43] demonstrated how\ntechnology can support shared illness management with adolescents and their parents by scaﬀold-\ning collaborative reconstructions of illness experiences. Motivated by these studies on the beneﬁts\nof collaborative illness management and the unique needs of adolescents, our study explores ado-\nlescents’ relationships with their parents and how shared practices can support adolescent health.\nIn contrast to other work, our study examines adolescents’ attitudes towards transition, how they\nlearn and practice self-management to prepare for transition, and which collaborative practices\nhelp or hinder their transition.\n\n2.3 Chronic Illness in Childhood and Adolescence\n\nCompared to their healthy peers, youth with chronic illnesses report lower levels of emotional\nwell-being and greater diﬃculty in establishing independence from their parents [102]. Recogniz-\ning the importance of fostering children’s autonomy [57], researchers have proposed systems to\nhelp children better understand and engage in health management (e.g., [5, 61, 87]). In their study\non how parents and children collaborate to manage Type 1 Diabetes, Cha et al. [20] found that\nchildren’s knowledge of illness management and motivation for self-care were critical in their\ntransition towards independence. While these studies underscore the need to support youth self-\nmanagement and engagement, they primarily focus on children under the age of 15, whose needs\nand preferences diﬀer from those of adolescents. During adolescence, parent-child relationships\nevolve, becoming more interdependent and reciprocal as adolescents strive for autonomy and re-\nduced parental control [14], which can lead to conﬂict [8]. This developmental period is critical\nbecause it precedes the tran'}, {'id': '2409.18275v1', 'title': 'Transitioning Together: Collaborative Work in Adolescent Chronic Illness Management', 'authors': ['Rachael Zehrung', 'Madhu Reddy', 'Yunan Chen'], 'published': '2024-09-26T20:35:18Z', 'summary': ""Adolescents with chronic illnesses need to learn self-management skills in preparation for the transition from pediatric to adult healthcare, which is associated with negative health outcomes for youth.

Designing technolo-\ngies to support the self-management of chronic conditions has long been a focus of personal in-\nformatics [74, 85], and prior research has examined the management of various conditions such\nas diabetes [31, 68, 69], asthma [29, 61, 91], and migraine [76, 84]. A common approach to man-\naging chronic illnesses is through self-tracking, which Li et al. [64] deﬁned in their stage-based\nmodel as preparation, collection, integration, reﬂection, and action. Self-tracking technologies for\nchronic illness support the collection and review of patient-generated health data, typically with\nthe goal of providing patients with actionable, data-driven insights to manage their symptoms\nand improve their well-being. For example, Geurts et al. proposed WalkWithMe [38], a mobile ap-\nplication that supports people with Multiple Sclerosis in setting goals and tracking their walking\nactivity. Likewise, Karkar et al. introduced TummyTrials [55], a tool to support individuals with\nirritable bowel syndrome in identifying their personal food triggers through self-experimentation.\nWhile these studies demonstrate the potential for self-tracking technologies to increase patients’\nself-awareness and promote health behavior change, self-tracking can also contribute to overall\ntreatment burden [3, 98] and elicit negative emotional reactions [54]. Self-tracking can be par-\nticularly frustrating for individuals with enigmatic chronic conditions such as Polycystic Ovary\nSyndrome and endometriosis due to heterogeneous symptoms and unexplained diﬀerences in re-\nsponse to treatment [22, 71]. Recognizing that self-tracking is a dynamic process, researchers have\nexamined how to support the social and emotional needs of individuals living with chronic illness\nbeyond medical treatment. For example, Ayobi et al. [7] highlighted the need for self-tracking tech-\nnologies to support mental well-being and foster mindful experiences, rather than focusing solely\non measurable disease indicators.

The design sessions provided insight into children\'s current caretaking tasks, how they would take care of a social robot, and how these new caretaking activities could be integrated into their daily routines.

In this paper, we explore the activity\nof caretaking of a social robot as a new and unique responsibility\nintroduced by in-home, long-term interactions with a robot.

Limited work shows how\npeople can benefit from expressing care towards non-robot applica-\ntions, such as chatbots. For example, people whom interacted with a\ncare-receiving chatbot by comforting it had increased positive men-\ntal health outcomes in self-compassion [18]. In another study [32], a\nsocial robot deployed in the workspace for 10 work days was found\nmore effective in helping users better manage their breaks. The\nsocial robot responded to “petting,” displayed agitation for succes-\nsive break alerts, and needed to be “fed” fruits represented by RFID\ncards. Research focused on caretaking in child-robot interactions\nis limited, however some studies reported children spontaneously\ndemonstrating robot care behaviors. For example, a social robot was\ndeployed in an early childhood education center for five months,\nand toddlers showed more caretaking behaviors for the robot (such\nas putting a blanket on the robot while saying “night-night”) than\nother objects such as an immobile robotic toy, treating the care-\nreceiving robot as a peer [36]. As part of their findings, Tanaka et al.\n[36] reported a set of factors that impacted the quality of children’s\ninteraction with the robot, including caretaking, rough-housing,\nhugging, touching the robot with objects, or touching the robot’s\nhead, face, trunk, arm, hand, leg, or foot. These factors manifested\n\nin children’s behaviors differently depending on the robot, for ex-\nample, violent rough-housing was observed only for the immobile\nrobotic toy, while children frequently hugged the care-receiving ro-\nbot.

Specifically, our approach takes into account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable model. Our approach presents two different methods, namely Green AI dynamic model cascading and Green AI dynamic model routing.

For example, whalers plan out a route they\nwill follow to search for whales; along this route, they may catch\nwhales but they may also leave empty-handed. How do we take route\ninformation, whaling search effort, and total catches into account to\nbetter estimate whale populations across the oceans?\n\nIn this paper, we take the first step towards addressing this ques-\ntion in the form of WhaleVis1,2—an interactive dashboard for an-\nalyzing millions of records of whaling data maintained by the In-\nternational Whaling Commission (IWC). WhaleVis was developed\nthrough a design study [19, 28, 34] in collaboration with domain\nexperts in aquatic and fishery sciences. The key idea of WhaleVis\nis to enable analysis of whale catches combined with that of whal-\ning expedition routes, to estimate the spatial distributions of whale\npopulations normalized by the search effort— a well known and non-\ntrivial problem in fisheries research involving many variables [30].\nThrough WhaleVis, we transform the recorded whaling events, into\na powerful tool for ocean conservation.\n\nA major challenge for WhaleVis is the bias of the IWC data in\nfavor of “positive” data points. It only records whales caught at a cer-\ntain geographic location by a certain expedition, but does not record\nfailed searches that occurred between locations, which are critical to\nunderstanding where whales actually were in the oceans. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a graph representation of whaling data\nin WhaleVis, where we model the catch locations as nodes of the\ngraph, and the expedition routes extracted from the data, as edges\nof the graph, refer Figure 1(A). In the current version of WhaleVis,\nthe density of edges (expedition routes) serves as a visual proxy\nfor search effort. This helps us to visually account for search effort\nwhile estimating whale population maps. In the future, this graph\nrepresentation can be leveraged to calculate search effort-normalized\npopulation maps rigorously using graph algorithms, e.g., network\ndiffusion [9]. It further opens up new avenues for performing graph\nanalysis on the data which can uncover new insights.\n\nWe develop WhaleVis in the Observable notebook environment,\nusing DuckDB [17] as the backend data processor, and D3.js for\nrendering. We demonstrate the use of WhaleVis through a real\nlife example in section 5 showing how WhaleVis enables effective\nanalysis of historical whaling events.\n\nIn summary, we make the following contributions:\n\n• characterization of the analysis tasks for the IWC whaling data,\n\n• an interactive dashboard for understanding and generating insights\n\nfrom historical whaling events,\n\nRelevant prior work in visualization dashboards for tracking wildlife\nconsists of both generic wildlife mapping frameworks, and dedicated\nwhale mapping dashboards. iNaturalist [15] is a citizen science tool\nfocusing on data collection, with visualizations only to aid basic\nsummarization of the data. EarthRanger [6] on the other hand, is a\nfeature rich interactive visualization and analysis dashboard which\nconnects to multiple data sources. However, being too generic, both\nthese tools do not cater to the kind of analysis whale domain experts\nare interested in.\n\nDedicated whale mapping dashboards include WhaleMap [32],\nHappyWhale [11], Pacific Whale [21], Obis-Seamap [20] and\nWhaleTest [33]. All these dashboards map whale sightings, but not\nwhaling events. Although Obis-Seamap and WhaleMap can connect\nto multiple data sources, they lack the level of transparency to easily\nincorporate the IWC whaling data. These interfaces also suffer from\nuser experience challenges (1) sub-optimal visualization designs\nhindering interpretability of the data—Obis-Seamap, WhaleMap; (2)\nunintuitive interactions for querying the data—HappyWhale, Obis-\nSeamap, PacificWhale, WhaleTest; and (3) high response time for\ninteractions (tens of seconds) to query the full data—HappyWhale,\nObis-Seamap, WhaleMap.\n\nTo facilitate spatial analysis based on geographic coordinates, we\nstick to the standard visualization approach for wildlife mapping i.e.,\nscatter-plots on geographic maps [6, 11, 15, 20, 21, 32, 33]. Scalable\nscatter-plots are employed for large datasets to avoid occlusion of\nmarks and ease cognition [10, 31]. These work by aggregating data\nto show fewer visual marks and visualizing details on demand. This\napproach is used in HappyWhale and Obis-Seamap.
