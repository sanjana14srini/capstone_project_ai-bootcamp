It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms.

              "content": "the circ-\nular  wall,  the  extremes  of  the  N-S  diameter  of \nthe  room  marked  the  points  where  the  circle  of \nlight  was  cast  at  noon  on  the  solstices.    Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019.

              "summary": "Astronomy arises very early in a civilization and evolves as the civilization advances. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms. Upon assuming strategically-placed holes in their ceilings we examine the internal movement of sunlight within these rooms and suggest that the larger structure of which they formed a part could have functioned as an astronomical observatory.",
              "content": "the circ-\nular  wall,  the  extremes  of  the  N-S  diameter  of \nthe  room  marked  the  points  where  the  circle  of \nlight  was  cast  at  noon  on  the  solstices.    Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019. We also wish to gratefully acknowledge \nthe permission given to us by the Archaeological \nSurvey of India to survey Dholavira in 2007, 2008 \nand  2010.

Feuerverger of an archaeologi-\ncal \ufb01nd that has been alleged by some to be the tomb of Jesus of\nNazareth. We show that his analysis rests on six faulty assumptions\nthat have been severely criticized by historians, archaeologists, and\nscholars in related disciplines. We summarize the results of an alter-\nnative computation using Bayes\u2019 theorem that estimates a probability\nof less than 2% that the Talpiot tomb belongs to Jesus of Nazareth.\n\n1. Introduction. Andrey Feuerverger notes in his article that assump-\ntions A.1 through A.9 are \u201cnot universally accepted.\u201d We argue that most\nhistorians and archaeologists actually disbelieve his key assumptions. (We\nagree with Feuerverger that the computational method he proposes can be\nextremely useful for di\ufb03cult problems such as the Talpiot tomb.)\n\nAssumption A.7 (the largest driver of his results) is almost universally\nrejected by scholars in the relevant \ufb01elds. Several other assumptions are\nextremely dubious, and each of them biases the result toward H1. Since all\nstatistical biases in Feuerverger\u2019s RR values accumulate multiplicatively, the\nnet e\ufb00ect is an enormous bias toward H1.\n\nIn this article, we will look \ufb01rst at the most egregious problem, the \u201cMari-\namenou\u201d inscription, which Simcha Jacobovici identi\ufb01ed with Mary Mag-\ndalene through a long chain of reasoning that has been severely criticized\nby historians. In less detail, we will examine \ufb01ve other serious problems. By\nFeuerverger\u2019s own account, eliminating two of these statistical biases (the\ntwo relating to Mary Magdalene) is su\ufb03cient to destroy the statistical sig-\nni\ufb01cance of H1. But all six statistical biases should be eliminated from the\nbaseline model of the problem.\n\nWe describe a series of calculations using Bayes\u2019 theorem that show that\nthe probability that the tomb belongs to Jesus of Nazareth is at most about\n2%, and may be much less.\n\nReceived November 2007; revised January 2008.\nKey words and phrases. Jesus of Nazareth, Talpiot tomb, Bayes\u2019 theorem, statistical\n\ninference, distribution of names, onomasticon.\n\nThis is an electronic reprint of the original article published by the\nInstitute of Mathematical Statistics in The Annals of Applied Statistics,\n2008, Vol. 2, No. 1, 84\u201390. This reprint di\ufb00ers from the original in pagination and\ntypographic detail.\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2\n\nR. INGERMANSON\n\n2. The primary problem: The \u201cMariamenou\u201d inscription. One of the\nossuaries bears an inscription that is usually translated \u201cMariamenou [who\nis also called] Mara.\u201d Simcha Jacobovici (2007) took this to be a variant\nof \u201cMariamne\u201d and interpreted it as a reference to Mary Magdalene. That\nis, he believed Mary Magdalene went by this name and that very few other\nwomen did. Jacobovici based his theory on the work of Dr. Francois Bovon.\nBut Bovon (2007) immediately repudiated this interpretation of his work\nin a web article. The key point is this statement: \u201cI do not believe that\nMariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene.\u201d\n\nDr. Richard Bauckham (2007), a renowned expert in \ufb01rst-century Jewish\nnames, has analyzed the \u201cMariamenou\u201d inscription in detail in a guest blog\narticle. His conclusions are:\n\n(1) Grammatically, \u201cMariamenou\u201d is the genitive case of the rare form\n\u201cMariamenon,\u201d a diminutive endearment deriving from the common name\n\u201cMariam.\u201d\n\n(2) The name is not derived from \u201cMariamne.\u201d\n(3) The name is very rare, and no other instance is found in antiquity.\n(4) We have no evidence that Mary Magdalene ever went by this name.\n\nOne should ask what name Mary Magdalene went by, according to the\ndata we have. Stephen Pfann (2007) has tabulated the references to Mary\nMagdalene in the various books of the New Testament, the earliest sources\nthat mention her. She is called by the formal name \u201cMariam\u201d four times\nand by the shorter, more intimate form \u201cMaria\u201d 10 times. These are the\nonly names used in the New Testament to refer to Mary Magdalene.\n\nWith these facts at hand, we can answer the following question: Assuming\nthat Mary Magdalene was actually buried in ancient Jerusalem, if one \ufb01nds\nthe inscription \u201cMariamenou\u201d in that city, what is the probability that it\nmight refer to Mary Magdalene? The answer is that the inscription is nei-\nther more nor less likely to refer to Mary Magdalene than to any other Mary\nof Jerusalem. (There were roughly 8500 other Marys.) This demolishes Ja-\ncobovici\u2019s theory, because \u201cMariamenou\u201d simply can\u2019t be identi\ufb01ed as \u201cthe\nreal name\u201d of Mary Magdalene.\n\nIn Feuerverger\u2019s article, he assigns an RR value to the Mariamenou in-\nscription that carries an illicit factor of (1/44), due to his belief that th"

It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms.

During  its \npeak  period,  between  2500 \nBC to 1900 BC, it covered an \narea of more than  1.5 million \nsquare  km  and  traded  over \nseveral  thousand  kilometres \nto western Asia and the horn \nof Africa (Wright, 2010).  The \nCivilisation  itself  was  settled \nalong  the  banks  and  upper \nreaches  of  two  major  rivers \neast  of  the  Thar  Desert  in \nwhat \nis  now  Pakistan  and \nIndia (Figure 1).  \n\nOne of its most interesting \nfeatures  is  several  large  and \nmedium-sized  settlements  in \nthe  present  day  Gujarat  reg-\nion in what is called the Kutch \n(Chakrabarti,  2004;  Rajesh \nand Patel, 2007).  Studies of \nthe  sites  in  the  Kutch  region \nsuggest  that  the  Little  Rann \nof  Kutch  was  covered  with \nwater  with  a  few  scattered \nislands.
