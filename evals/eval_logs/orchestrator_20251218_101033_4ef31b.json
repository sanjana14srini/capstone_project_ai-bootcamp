Research highlights the importance of understanding these disorders' etiology and potential interventions. Notably, technology plays a vital role in formulating and implementing effective health solutions. Recent studies have discussed the role of robotics in mental health, emphasizing its potential benefits in addressing challenges faced by youth. Robotics and technology in mental health care present innovative solutions for understanding and managing disorders affecting children and adolescents. Digital mental health services have gained traction, particularly post-COVID-19, highlighting the need for accessible, evidence-based interventions targeted at this population. \n\n## References\n- [Robotics Technology in Mental Health Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02281v1)\n- [Technology in Association With Mental Health: Meta-ethnography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10513v2)\n- [Bayesian inference and role of astrocytes in amyloid-beta dynamics with modelling of Alzheimer's disease using clinical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12520v1)\n\n            Current query: literature review on histories of childhoods and media in colonial era\n        ",

A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms. In this work, we propose a computational method for assessing politicization in online conversations based on topic shifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in online conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective. Instead, we learn from a seed of political keywords and use Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning to detect political comments in reaction to non-political news articles posted on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. Our findings indicate that all platforms show evidence of politicization as discussion around topics adjacent to politics such as economy, crime and drugs tend to shift to politics. Even the least politicized topics had the rate in which their topics shift to politics increased in the lead up to the elections and after other political events in Brazil -- an evidence of politicization.",

              "summary": "Politicization is a social phenomenon studied by political science characterized by the extent to which ideas and facts are given a political tone. A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms. In this work, we propose a computational method for assessing politicization in online conversations based on topic shifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in online conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective. Instead, we learn from a seed of political keywords and use Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning to detect political comments in reaction to non-political news articles posted on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. Our findings indicate that all platforms show evidence of politicization as discussion around topics adjacent to politics such as economy, crime and drugs tend to shift to politics. Even the least politicized topics had the rate in which their topics shift to politics increased in the lead up to the elections and after other political events in Brazil -- an evidence of politicization.",
              "content": "ted, paraphrased, and\nmodified (while keeping the general meaning).\n\nFigure 6: Average number of comments between topic shifts\ntoward politics for all YouTube videos by month. A smaller\nnumber means that users shift more frequently toward poli-\ntics. In the start of 2022 there were few videos of the most\npoliticized topics, hence the larger confidence interval (gray\narea). Again, an increase in topic shifts toward politics coin-\ncides with the election period.\n\nOur work focuses on assessing and characterizing politi-\ncization without using any manual labels, which can acceler-\nate and encourage further research in the political sciences.\nWhile we acknowledge that the accuracy of the classifier in\nthe range of 84% is a potential threat to the validity of the re-\nsults, since a correct topic shift is a result of a correct classi-\nfication of both the news posts and the comment, we believe\nthe effect of the prediction error is minimized due to two\nefforts: (1) we manually discarded the misclassified topical\nclusters of news posts, and (2) since each post receives on\naverage tenths or hundreds of comments (Table 1), the errors\ntend to cancel out and a signal of politicization still emerges,\nas the analysis in Tables 8 and 9, and Figure 6 made clear.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Igor Joaquim da Silva Costa,\nMateus F.
