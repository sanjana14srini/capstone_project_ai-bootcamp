Key contributions include: 1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This method introduces a correction term for server-side aggregation in federated learning settings, addressing key challenges such as Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. It maintains high performance while ensuring computational efficiency (arXiv:2411.14961). 2. **LoRA-RITE**: A novel optimizer that enforces transformation invariance, dominating the optimization process. It shows consistent improvements over existing methods by stabilizing updates while remaining computationally efficient (arXiv:2410.20625). 3. **PLoP**: This lightweight method allows for automatic identification of the most effective module types for LoRA adapter placement, optimizing the fine-tuning process across various tasks (arXiv:2506.20629). Together, these studies represent significant strides in utilizing LoRA for efficient model training and adaptation. \n\n## References\n- [LoRA-FAIR: Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning with Aggregation and Initialization Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961v3)\n- [LoRA Done RITE: Robust Invariant Transformation Equilibration for LoRA Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20625v2)\n- [PLoP: Precise LoRA Placement for Efficient Finetuning of Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20629v1)\n\n            Current query: explain the most important aspect of self-attention in LLMs\n        ",

Secondly, the self-attention matrix is intrin-\nsically an asymmetric kernel matrix [12, 21].

Despite the prevailing advantages, theoretical understandings\ntowards Transformers seem yet lagged behind its unprecedented empirical performance.\n\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n2Our implementation is available at https://github.com/yingyichen-cyy/PrimalAttention\n\n37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFigure 1: Spectrum analysis of the self-attention matrix on ImageNet-1K [23]. (a)-(c) plot the\ncumulative explained variance regarding the singular values of the attention matrix with mean and\nstandard deviation of the chosen layers in pre-trained DeiT-Small/16 [7] and Primal.+DeiT-Small/16\n(ours): the attention matrix attains sharper singular value decays in deeper layers, also shown in (d).\nNote that we also plot the cumulative explained variance curves of the self-attention matrix from\nthe last layer, i.e., the 11-th layer denoted by \u201cL[11]\u201d, of both models in (c). Our method shows an\nenhanced low-rank property of the attention matrix upon the baseline.\n\nRecently, the kernel-based perspective has been proposed where the dot-product attention opera-\ntion is shown as a kernel matrix [12]. This finding is quite encouraging by bridging kernels [13]\nwith Transformers, as kernel methods have long been well studied with good interpretation ability.\nFollowing this spirit, different works have been proposed subsequently to improve self-attention,\ne.g., [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. However, in these works, the applied kernel techniques rely on Mercer\nkernels [20] requesting symmetry, which is inconsistent with the intrinsically asymmetric setups of\nself-attention. In [21], it analytically characterizes the attention by asymmetric kernels based on\nReproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) [22]. Nonetheless, neither the asymmetry property\nnor the related optimization is utilized for improvements. In [19], self-attention is derived with\na primal-dual representation from the support vector regression, which still adopts the technique\nfor Mercer kernels. Moreover, in the cast supervised task, the assumed ground-truth outputs of\nself-attention are practically non-existent, making it difficult to be applied in the optimization.\n\nIn this work, we provide a novel perspective to interpret self-attention with a primal-dual represen-\ntation based on asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which fills the gap of\ndismissing the asymmetry between theory and implementation. Specifically, in this unsupervised\nsetup, we propose to remodel self-attention in the primal representation, namely, Primal-Attention,\nand to optimize it accordingly. Our method is driven by two major motivations. Firstly, we observe\nthat attention matrices in Transformers can be low-rank, as shown in Figure 1(d), and this property\nbecomes more significant towards deeper network layers. Secondly, the self-attention matrix is intrin-\nsically an asymmetric kernel matrix [12, 21]. To this end, we propose KSVD for self-attention, which\ntakes both low-rank and asymmetric properties into consideration. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric self-attention and\napplies it to modelling and optimization. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We characterize self-attention by KSVD with asymmetric kernels. Different from existing\nworks employing symmetric kernel-based methods, we take asymmetry into account so as\nto be more consistent with the real setups in self-attention. (Section 2)\n\n\u2022 We derive a primal-dual representation for self-attention through KSVD, and propose a novel\nattention in the primal, named Primal-Attention, avoiding the expensive kernel computation\nin the dual. With KSVD, the values are interpreted as the projection weights that yield\nmaximal variances of features, and the low-rank property can be pursued by confining the\nprojection numbers. (Section 3, Section 4)\n\n\u2022 We prove that the stationary solution to the derived KSVD leads to a zero-value objective of\nthe unconstrained primal problem. Therefore, the optimization of KSVD in Primal-Attention\ncan be efficiently implemented by minimizing a regularization term added to the loss, with\nno need of extra decomposition operations.

The linear-algebraic tradition of distributional semantics and matrix factorization in natural\n\nlanguage processing.\n\nThe goal is to situate the present analysis within both traditions and within recent theoretical anal-\nyses of attention and representation learning.\nSelf-attention was first introduced as a differentiable alignment mechanism for neural machine\ntranslation [2], where it allowed a decoder to focus selectively on encoder states relevant to each\ngenerated word. It was then generalized into the transformer architecture [9], in which attention\nbecame the core representational primitive rather than an auxiliary alignment tool. Subsequent\nwork examined attention\u2019s internal structure, identifying head specialization, syntactic alignment,\nand interpretability patterns that arise during training [3, 8]. These studies established attention\nas both a computational and a linguistic phenomenon, but typically treated its algebraic form as\ngiven.\nA parallel and older thread of research\u2014distributional semantics\u2014treated word meaning as emerg-\ning from the co-occurrence structure of language data. Methods such as latent semantic analysis,\npositive pointwise mutual information (PMI), and global vector embeddings [7, 6, 1] modeled this\nstructure explicitly through matrix factorization, capturing semantic similarity and analogy rela-\ntions in linear spaces. These approaches anticipated many of the representational properties later\nrediscovered in deep embeddings, but lacked a mechanism for adapting corpus-level statistics to\nspecific sentence contexts.\nRecent theoretical work has interpreted attention through various mathematical frameworks, in-\ncluding structured linear operators and kernel methods [5, 4].\n[10]\nanalyze the learning dynamics of linear attention, providing another mathematical perspective on\nhow transformers capture contextual relationships. Our contribution complements these analyses\nby showing how the self-attention equations directly from corpus projection algebra: attention\nemerges as the unique asymmetric refinement of a co-occurrence operator restricted to an input\nsequence.\nWhile the connection between distributional semantics and neural embeddings is well-established\n[7, 6], and attention mechanisms have been analyzed through various theoretical lenses [5, 4], our\nwork provides a systematic analysis of the self-attention mechanism from corpus projection prin-\nciples.

              "summary": "This paper presents a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by connecting it to distributional semantics principles. We show that self-attention emerges from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.",
