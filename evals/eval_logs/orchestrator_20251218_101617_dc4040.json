Research highlights the importance of understanding these disorders' etiology and potential interventions. Notably, technology plays a vital role in formulating and implementing effective health solutions. Recent studies have discussed the role of robotics in mental health, emphasizing its potential benefits in addressing challenges faced by youth. Robotics and technology in mental health care present innovative solutions for understanding and managing disorders affecting children and adolescents. Digital mental health services have gained traction, particularly post-COVID-19, highlighting the need for accessible, evidence-based interventions targeted at this population. \n\n## References\n- [Robotics Technology in Mental Health Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02281v1)\n- [Technology in Association With Mental Health: Meta-ethnography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10513v2)\n- [Bayesian inference and role of astrocytes in amyloid-beta dynamics with modelling of Alzheimer's disease using clinical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12520v1)\n literature review on histories of childhoods and media in colonial era # Literature Review on Histories of Childhoods and Media in Colonial Era\n\n## Summary \n There is currently limited research available specifically addressing the histories of childhoods and media in the colonial era. A search through available arXiv papers yielded no directly relevant literature. However, it is an important and under-explored area that may benefit from future research, particularly looking at how media shaped perceptions of childhood in various colonial contexts. Suggested areas for further exploration include childhood studies related to colonial experiences, media representation of children during colonization, and comprehensive historical analyses of childhoods in diverse colonial environments. Such studies could contribute significantly to understanding the socio-cultural dynamics of childhood through historical and media lenses that initially operated during the era of colonization. \n\n## References\n- [Robotics Technology in Mental Health Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02281v1)\n- [Technology in Association With Mental Health: Meta-ethnography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10513v2)\n- [Bayesian inference and role of astrocytes in amyloid-beta dynamics with modelling of Alzheimer's disease using clinical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12520v1)\n latest cancer research based on whales # WhaleVis: Visualizing the History of Commercial Whaling\n\n## Summary \n Whales play a crucial role in the oceanic ecosystem.

Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.",

              "summary": "The threats faced by cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure have motivated the development of different attack detection mechanisms, such as those that monitor for violations of invariants, i.e. properties that always hold in normal operation. Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.",

With the world population still growing, food security remains to be one of the most\nimportant issues for many countries and machine learning applications in agriculture and horticulture\ncan help alleviate this issue. One of such applications is to use machine learning to improve optimal\ncontrol in greenhouses. For tuning and learning of the optimal controllers in the greenhouses,\nthere is a need to use simulators, as it is prohibitively expensive to do so in the real systems. The\nmost prominent and successful class of models to simulate the greenhouses are based on physical\nprocesses. Physics-based greenhouse models are well-studied ([12], [6], [13]) and have been used\nfor optimal greenhouse control, for example, in [1]. However, those models are usually \ufb01xed, and\ntheir parameters have to be hand-tuned for each greenhouse. This limits the rapid deployment and\nadaptation of such models in commercial settings. On the other hand, differentiable physics ([10],\n[11]) is an emerging interdisciplinary paradigm where automatic differentiation [8] is applied in\nthe numerical simulation of physical systems and has the potential to facilitate automatic learning\nof physical systems parameters. Furthermore, many optimal control algorithms, for example, the\nDirect Multiple Shooting method [2], require not only an accurate model of the dynamics but also\nthe Jacobian and Hessian of the dynamic with respect to the state vector. Thus, there is a need to\ndevelop an accurate and differentiable physics-based greenhouse simulation implementation that\ncan be trained end-to-end in order to address those challenges and allow better adoption of machine\nlearning in greenhouse optimal control.

              "summary": "In recent years, precision agriculture that uses modern information and communication technologies is becoming very popular. Raw and semi-processed agricultural data are usually collected through various sources, such as: Internet of Thing (IoT), sensors, satellites, weather stations, robots, farm equipment, farmers and agribusinesses, etc. Besides, agricultural datasets are very large, complex, unstructured, heterogeneous, non-standardized, and inconsistent. Hence, the agricultural data mining is considered as Big Data application in terms of volume, variety, velocity and veracity. It is a key foundation to establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will enable resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. In this paper, we designed and implemented a continental level agricultural data warehouse by combining Hive, MongoDB and Cassandra. Our data warehouse capabilities: (1) flexible schema; (2) data integration from real agricultural multi datasets; (3) data science and business intelligent support; (4) high performance; (5) high storage; (6) security; (7) governance and monitoring; (8) replication and recovery; (9) consistency, availability and partition tolerant; (10) distributed and cloud deployment. We also evaluate the performance of our data warehouse.",

We designed and implemented the agri-\ncultural DW by combining Hive, MongoDB and Cassandra DWs to exploit their\n\n\fadvantages and overcome their limitations. Our DW includes necessary mod-\nules to deal with large scale and e\ufb03cient analytics for agricultural Big Data.\nAdditionally, the presented schema herein was optimised for the real agricul-\ntural datasets that were made available to us. The schema been designed as a\nconstellation so it is \ufb02exible to adapt to other agricultural datasets and quality\ncriteria of agricultural Big Data. Moreover, using the short demo, we outlined a\ncomplex HQL query that enabled knowledge extraction from our DW to opti-\nmize of agricultural operations. Finally, through particular reading queries using\npopular HQL/SQL commands, our DW storage outperforms MySQL by far.\n\nIn the future works, we shall pursue the deployment of our agricultural DW\non a cloud system and implement more functionalities to exploit this DW.

For example, a greenhouse may not have sensors to measure the temperature\nof the plant canopy, and it is considered an unobservable state. Another example is that it is not\npossible to quantify the amount of carbohydrate in the plant stem without causing harm to the plant\nand this also an unobservable state. The unobservable states are not available in the data collection\nprocess but may contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the dynamics of a greenhouse.

Thus, there is a need to\ndevelop an accurate and differentiable physics-based greenhouse simulation implementation that\ncan be trained end-to-end in order to address those challenges and allow better adoption of machine\nlearning in greenhouse optimal control. This work presents such a greenhouse model implementation\nand proposes an ef\ufb01cient training procedure to address various problems when training the model.\n\nThe contributions of this paper are as follow: (1) We present a fully interpretable and differentiable\nphysics-based greenhouse model implementation that can be trained end-to-end and can be used\nfor accurate simulation of the greenhouse and for optimal greenhouse control. (2) We propose an\n\nMachine Learning and the Physical Sciences workshop, NeurIPS 2022.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFigure 1: Individual loss components and total loss of the climate states on Croperator dataset.\n\nef\ufb01cient and numerically stable way to solve the linear system of differential equations for greenhouse\ndynamics, which can be used for similar simulation systems that use differential equations. (3) We\npropose an ef\ufb01cient and effective training procedure to handle dif\ufb01culties in training long sequential\ngreenhouse data. (4) As a proof of concept, we show some good preliminary results in predicting the\ncumulative weight and number of fruits harvested in a greenhouse that grows cucumbers.\n\n2 Physics-based Greenhouse Simulation Model\n\n2.1 Greenhouse simulation model formulation\n\nLet D = {(xi, ui)|i = 0..N } be the sequential trajectory of a greenhouse with length N in a single\ngrowing season. xi is the Dx-dimension state vector and ui is the Du-dimension control vector at\ntime step t. The time steps are divided equally in time, with \u2206t being the interval between time steps.\n\nThe state vector xi includes both climate states and crop states. Climate states are states that are\nrelated or contribute to the climate dynamic in the greenhouse. For example: air temperature, air\nhumidity, how much CO2 is in the air, etc. Crop states are states that are related to the plants. For\nexample: average plant temperature in the last 24 hours, carbohydrate stored in the leaf, fruits, etc.\nHowever, many states are unobservable, either due to the lack of sensors or due to the impossibility\nof measuring them. For example, a greenhouse may not have sensors to measure the temperature\nof the plant canopy, and it is considered an unobservable state. Another example is that it is not\npossible to quantify the amount of carbohydrate in the plant stem without causing harm to the plant\nand this also an unobservable state. The unobservable states are not available in the data collection\nprocess but may contribute signi\ufb01cantly to the dynamics of a greenhouse. To accurately simulate\nthe dynamics of a greenhouse, it is important to handle the missing states. A process for handling\nmissing states during training is described in the experiment section 3.2. The control vector ui also\nincludes control for both climate and crop. For example, setpoints of the heating pipes, setpoints of\nthe fogging system, or harvesting action of the fruits.\n\nA greenhouse simulator S\u03b8, parameterized by the parameter vector \u03b8, calculates a prediction of T\nnext states xi+1, ..., xi+T given the starting state xi and the control vectors ui, ..., ui+T \u22121 using the\nrecursive formulation: xk+1 = S\u03b8(xk, uk) for k = i \u2192 i + T \u2212 1. The physics-based greenhouse\nsimulation model predicts the next state xk+1 by solving a system of linear differential equations:\n\n\u02d9x = A\u03b8(x, u)x + b\u03b8(x, u)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u02d9x is the derivative of the state vector x over time. A\u03b8(x, u) is a Dx \u00d7 Dx matrix and b\u03b8(x, u)\nis a Dx dimensional vector. Both terms are functions of the state vector x and the control vector u,\nand are parameterized by \u03b8. The parameter vector \u03b8 consists of parameters that affect the physical\nand biological processes in the greenhouse. Such parameterization scheme is fully interpretable while\nalso allows human experts to contribute to the process of tuning the model. Examples of physical\nprocesses parameters include the height of the greenhouse, the normalized area of the ventilation,\nparameters of greenhouse screens, the capacity of the fogging system,"
