Research highlights the importance of understanding these disorders' etiology and potential interventions. Notably, technology plays a vital role in formulating and implementing effective health solutions. Recent studies have discussed the role of robotics in mental health, emphasizing its potential benefits in addressing challenges faced by youth. Robotics and technology in mental health care present innovative solutions for understanding and managing disorders affecting children and adolescents. Digital mental health services have gained traction, particularly post-COVID-19, highlighting the need for accessible, evidence-based interventions targeted at this population. \n\n## References\n- [Robotics Technology in Mental Health Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02281v1)\n- [Technology in Association With Mental Health: Meta-ethnography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10513v2)\n- [Bayesian inference and role of astrocytes in amyloid-beta dynamics with modelling of Alzheimer's disease using clinical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12520v1)\n literature review on histories of childhoods and media in colonial era # Literature Review on Histories of Childhoods and Media in Colonial Era\n\n## Summary \n There is currently limited research available specifically addressing the histories of childhoods and media in the colonial era. A search through available arXiv papers yielded no directly relevant literature. However, it is an important and under-explored area that may benefit from future research, particularly looking at how media shaped perceptions of childhood in various colonial contexts. Suggested areas for further exploration include childhood studies related to colonial experiences, media representation of children during colonization, and comprehensive historical analyses of childhoods in diverse colonial environments. Such studies could contribute significantly to understanding the socio-cultural dynamics of childhood through historical and media lenses that initially operated during the era of colonization. \n\n## References\n- [Robotics Technology in Mental Health Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02281v1)\n- [Technology in Association With Mental Health: Meta-ethnography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10513v2)\n- [Bayesian inference and role of astrocytes in amyloid-beta dynamics with modelling of Alzheimer's disease using clinical data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12520v1)\n\n            Current query: latest cancer research based on whales\n        ",

How do we take route\ninformation, whaling search effort, and total catches into account to\nbetter estimate whale populations across the oceans?\n\nIn this paper, we take the first step towards addressing this ques-\ntion in the form of WhaleVis1,2\u2014an interactive dashboard for an-\nalyzing millions of records of whaling data maintained by the In-\nternational Whaling Commission (IWC). WhaleVis was developed\nthrough a design study [19, 28, 34] in collaboration with domain\nexperts in aquatic and fishery sciences. The key idea of WhaleVis\nis to enable analysis of whale catches combined with that of whal-\ning expedition routes, to estimate the spatial distributions of whale\npopulations normalized by the search effort\u2014 a well known and non-\ntrivial problem in fisheries research involving many variables [30].\nThrough WhaleVis, we transform the recorded whaling events, into\na powerful tool for ocean conservation.\n\nA major challenge for WhaleVis is the bias of the IWC data in\nfavor of \u201cpositive\u201d data points. It only records whales caught at a cer-\ntain geographic location by a certain expedition, but does not record\nfailed searches that occurred between locations, which are critical to\nunderstanding where whales actually were in the oceans. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a graph representation of whaling data\nin WhaleVis, where we model the catch locations as nodes of the\ngraph, and the expedition routes extracted from the data, as edges\nof the graph, refer Figure 1(A). In the current version of WhaleVis,\nthe density of edges (expedition routes) serves as a visual proxy\nfor search effort. This helps us to visually account for search effort\nwhile estimating whale population maps. In the future, this graph\nrepresentation can be leveraged to calculate search effort-normalized\npopulation maps rigorously using graph algorithms, e.g., network\ndiffusion [9]. It further opens up new avenues for performing graph\nanalysis on the data which can uncover new insights.\n\nWe develop WhaleVis in the Observable notebook environment,\nusing DuckDB [17] as the backend data processor, and D3.js for\nrendering. We demonstrate the use of WhaleVis through a real\nlife example in section 5 showing how WhaleVis enables effective\nanalysis of historical wh"

Effectively\nprotecting whales requires understanding the spatial distribution of\ntheir populations. However, tracking whales is a high effort and low-\nyield task [4, 12]. It requires scanning entire oceans for relatively\nsmall populations of whales, essentially searching for needles in a\nhaystack. However, whale researchers observe that this is exactly\nwhat commercial whale hunting expeditions did to catch whales.\nThus, commercial whale hunting a.k.a. whaling data could be used\nfor altruistic purposes by using it to estimate changes in whale\npopulations across the oceans over time.\n\nHowever, commercial whaling data cannot be easily repurposed\nto infer the spatial distribution of whales. In particular, the whaling\ndataset emphasizes the results i.e., catches, but not the effort whalers\nplaced in searching for whales, and where whales actually live.\nThus, there are multiple levels of inference that must be managed\nwhen translating whale catches (the knowns) into useful population\ndata (the unknown). For example, whalers plan out a route they\nwill follow to search for whales; along this route, they may catch\nwhales but they may also leave empty-handed. How do we take route\ninformation, whaling search effort, and total catches into account to\nbetter estimate whale populations across the oceans?\n\nIn this paper, we take the first step towards addressing this ques-\ntion in the form of WhaleVis1,2\u2014an interactive"
