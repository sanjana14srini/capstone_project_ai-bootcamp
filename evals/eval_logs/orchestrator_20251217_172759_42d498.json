Key contributions include: 1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This method introduces a correction term for server-side aggregation in federated learning settings, addressing key challenges such as Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. It maintains high performance while ensuring computational efficiency (arXiv:2411.14961). 2. **LoRA-RITE**: A novel optimizer that enforces transformation invariance, dominating the optimization process. It shows consistent improvements over existing methods by stabilizing updates while remaining computationally efficient (arXiv:2410.20625). 3. **PLoP**: This lightweight method allows for automatic identification of the most effective module types for LoRA adapter placement, optimizing the fine-tuning process across various tasks (arXiv:2506.20629). Together, these studies represent significant strides in utilizing LoRA for efficient model training and adaptation. \n\n## References\n- [LoRA-FAIR: Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning with Aggregation and Initialization Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961v3)\n- [LoRA Done RITE: Robust Invariant Transformation Equilibration for LoRA Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20625v2)\n- [PLoP: Precise LoRA Placement for Efficient Finetuning of Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20629v1)\n explain the most important aspect of self-attention in LLMs # Importance of Self-Attention in Large Language Models\n\n## Summary \n Self-attention plays a crucial role in transforming sequences into contextual representations by capturing the dependencies and relationships between tokens in a flexible manner. Self-attention allows each token to focus on other relevant tokens in the input sequence, facilitating the learning of complex patterns. Recent research provides mathematical interpretations that reveal innovative perspectives on self-attention. One study highlights how self-attention correlates with distributional semantics principles, suggesting that it involves projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into a sequence context, with the query-key-value mechanism emerging as a natural asymmetric extension to model directional relationships. Improvements also address computation efficiency and optimization aspects of self-attention mechanisms, enabling state-of-the-art performance in various applications. Overall, self-attention is essential for the success of transformer architectures in processing language and other data efficiently. \n\n## References\n- [Self-Attention as Distributional Projection: A Unified Interpretation of Transformer Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13780v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # Framework behind Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is exemplified by the MCP4EDA framework, the first of its kind that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to manage and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interaction. This framework integrates components such as Yosys synthesis, Icarus Verilog simulation, OpenLane place-and-route, GTKWave analysis, and KLayout visualization. It facilitates complex EDA workflows via conversational interfaces, enabling designers to use AI assistants for automation. A key innovation of MCP4EDA is its backend-aware synthesis optimization, where LLMs utilize actual post-layout performance metrics to iteratively refine design scripts, leading to improved timing closure and area efficiency by 15-30% and 10-20% respectively compared to traditional methods. This innovative methodology enhances adaptability within design processes, moving away from fixed approaches that rely on outdated or inaccurate models. \n\n## References\n- [MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol RTL-to-GDSII Automation with Backend Aware Synthesis Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19570v1)\n\n            Current query: when is sub-game perfect equilibria also a nash equilibria in an infinite game?\n        ",

As discussed in the\nprevious section, the results of Bohnenblust et al. [7] suggest a separation between the sub-matrix\nwith row indices (cid:83)\nsupp(y) (which we will refer to as the optimal\nx\u2208X\u22c6\n\nsupp(x) and column indices (cid:83)\ny\u2208Y\u22c6\n\nsub-matrix) and the rest of the matrix. Our goal is to formalize this separation and therefore leverage\nit to identify the set of all Nash equilibria while minimizing the number of queries required. In the\nspecific case of strict Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (strict PSNE), this separation is inherently\npresent, as a strict PSNE is uniquely the least in its row and uniquely the highest in its column.\nTherefore, one possible approach involves constructing a large matrix with (cid:0) n\n(cid:1)\n(cid:1) rows and (cid:0) n\nk1\nk2\ncolumns, where each entry is bijectively mapped to a k1 \u00d7 k2 sub-matrix of A. The values of these\nentries are determined by their corresponding sub-matrices in A, and this large matrix possesses a\nstrict PSNE that maps to the optimal sub-matrix of A.\n\nAssuming we can construct such a matrix, it remains unclear how to query the entries of this\nlarge matrix without significantly increasing the query complexity of our algorithm. The algorithm\nproposed by Bienstock et al. [5] is inadequate for this purpose because it queries entries diagonally.\nIf we applied a similar diagonal querying strategy to our large matrix, we would end up querying\nall entries of the original matrix A. Instead, we propose a randomized algorithm for finding strict\nPSNE that operates differently from the one described by Bienstock et al. [5]. Specifically, if we\n\n3\n\n\fhave access to query oracles where a single call returns either the entire row or the entire column,\nour algorithm can identify the strict PSNE by making O(log2(r)) oracle calls, where r is the total\nnumber of rows and columns in the input matrix with a strict PSNE. We can also design a query\noracle for the larger matrix that returns a row or column by querying at most O(nk) entries of A.\nHence, the query complexity of finding the strict PSNE of the large matrix will be nearly n \u00b7 poly(k).\nOne approach to creating such a large matrix is to compute the value of the game on the sub-\nmatrix mapped to each entry and use that as the entry\u2019s value. While this method ensures that\nthe entry in the resulting matrix that maps to the optimal sub-matrix is a Pure Strategy Nash\nEquilibrium (PSNE)\u2014an entry that is the smallest in its row and the largest in its column\u2014it\nmay not necessarily be a strict PSNE.

Fearnley and Savani (2016) showed that for any randomized algorithm, there exists an $n \\times n$ input matrix where it needs to query $\u03a9(n^2)$ entries in expectation to compute a single Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, Bienstock et al. (1991) showed that there is a special class of matrices for which one can query $O(n)$ entries and compute its set of all Nash equilibria. However, these results do not fully characterize the query complexity of finding the set of all Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum matrix games.\n  In this work, we characterize the query complexity of finding the set of all Nash equilibria $\\mathcal X_\\star \\times \\mathcal Y_\\star$ in terms of the number of rows $n$ of the input matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, row support size $k_1 := |\\bigcup_{x \\in \\mathcal X_\\star} \\text{supp}(x)|$, and column support size $k_2 := |\\bigcup_{y \\in \\mathcal Y_\\star} \\text{supp}(y)|$. We design a simple yet non-trivial randomized algorithm that, with probability $1 - \u03b4$, returns the set of all Nash equilibria $\\mathcal X_\\star \\times \\mathcal Y_\\star$ by querying at most $O(nk^5 \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n / \u03b4))$ entries of the input matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, where $k := \\max\\{k_1, k_2\\}$. This upper bound is tight up to a factor of $\\text{poly}(k)$, as we show that for any randomized algorithm, there exists an $n \\times n$ input matrix with $\\min\\{k_1, k_2\\} = 1$, for which it needs to query $\u03a9(nk)$ entries in expectation in order to find the set of all Nash equilibria $\\mathcal X_\\star \\times \\mathcal Y_\\star$.",

Our main technical\n\nTheorem 1. There exists a randomized algorithm that, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, queries\n\u03b4 )) entries of the input matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n and returns the set of all Nash equilibria\nO(nk5 \u00b7 log n \u00b7 log( n\nX\u22c6 \u00d7 Y\u22c6.\n\nWe outline the innovative techniques used to achieve the result above. As discussed in the\nprevious section, the results of Bohnenblust et al. [7] suggest a separation between the sub-matrix\nwith row indices (cid:83)\nsupp(y) (which we will refer to as the optimal\nx\u2208X\u22c6\n\nsupp(x) and column indices (cid:83)\ny\u2208Y\u22c6\n\nsub-matrix) and the rest of the matrix. Our goal is to formalize this separation and therefore leverage\nit to identify the set of all Nash equilibria while minimizing the number of queries required. In the\nspecific case of strict Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (strict PSNE), this separation is inherently\npresent, as a strict PSNE is uniquely the least in its row and uniquely the highest in its column.\nTherefore, one possible approach involves constructing a large matrix with (cid:0) n\n(cid:1)\n(cid:1) rows and (cid:0) n\nk1\nk2\ncolumns, where each entry is bijectively mapped to a k1 \u00d7 k2 sub-matrix of A. The values of these\nentries are determined by their corresponding sub-matrices in A, and this large matrix possesses a\nstrict PSNE that maps to the optimal sub-matrix of A.\n\nAssuming we can construct such a matrix, it remains unclear how to query the entries of this\nlarge matrix without significantly increasing the query complexity of our algorithm. The algorithm\nproposed by Bienstock et al. [5] is inadequate for this purpose because it queries entries diagonally.\nIf we applied a similar diagonal querying strategy to our large matrix, we would end up querying\nall entries of the original matrix A. Instead, we propose a randomized algorithm for finding strict\nPSNE that operates differently from the one described by Bienstock et al. [5]. Specifically, if we\n\n3\n\n\fhave access to query oracles where a single call returns either the entire row or the entire column,\nour algorithm can identify the strict PSNE by making O(log2(r)) oracle calls, where r is the total\nnumber of rows and columns in the input matrix with a strict PSNE. We can also design a query\noracle for the larger matrix that returns a row or column by querying at most O(nk) entries of A.\nHence, the query complexity of finding the strict PSNE of the large matrix will be nearly n \u00b7 poly(k).\nOne approach to creating such a large matrix is to compute the value of the game on the sub-\nmatrix mapped to each entry and use that as the entry\u2019s value. While this method ensures that\nthe entry in the resulting matrix that maps to the optimal sub-matrix is a Pure Strategy Nash\nEquilibrium (PSNE)\u2014an entry that is the smallest in its row and the largest in its column\u2014it\nmay not necessarily be a strict PSNE. However, if we are given a set of values V that includes the\nvalue of the game V \u22c6\n, we can modify the previously constructed matrix to ensure that the PSNE\nA\nbecomes a strict PSNE. Our randomized algorithm for finding the strict PSNE has the additional\nadvantage that, whenever the matrix contains a PSNE, it will, with high probability, compute a set\nthat includes the value of the game V \u22c6\nA\n\nNow, we describe how to make the PSNE that maps to the optimal sub-matrix (which we will\nrefer to as the optimal PSNE) a strict PSNE. Consider an entry that is in the column of the optimal\nPSNE and has a value equal to V \u22c6\n. If this entry is not the optimal PSNE, using Lemma 1, we\nA\ncan show that the sub-matrix it maps to lacks a Nash equilibrium with all the rows in its support,\nalthough it does have a Nash equilibrium wi"

It allows a player in a game to believe that her opponent may be either less or as sophisticated as, she is, a view supported in psychology. We apply NLK to data from five published papers on static, dynamic, and auction games. NLK provides different predictions than those of the NE and Level-K; moreover, a simple version of NLK explains the experimental data better in many cases, with the same or lower number of parameters. We discuss extensions to games with more than two players and heterogeneous beliefs.",
              "content": "ribution of actions but ignore the correlation between actions and the\nspecific players\u2019 types who chose those actions. In their general model, \ud835\udf12-CE, beliefs are a weighted\naverage of beliefs in fully cursed opponents (with weight \ud835\udf12 ) and Bayesian Nash opponents (with\nweight (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf12) ). The CE characterizes heterogeneous behaviors by different cursed levels (with\n\ud835\udf12 = 1 being fully cursed, and \ud835\udf12 = 0 being BNE). However, CE reduces to NE when there is complete\ninformation. Hence, it cannot be applied to explain deviations from NE in both static and dynamic\ngames with complete information. Conceptually, the CE models bounded rational agents as only\npartially taking.into.account how other players\u2019 actions depend on their type. By contrast, NLK\nallows a player to consider the possibility that the other player is a naive player or another NLK\nplayer like herself. [Kets, 2012] extends the type space of [Harsanyi, 1973], by allowing players to\nhave a finite instead of infinite depth of reasoning. However, different from NLK, it required that\nthe depth of reasoning be the same for all players, and beliefs that the other player might be less\nsophisticated are not allowed.\n\nFor applications to dynamic games with perfect information and recall, analogy-based expectation\nequilibrium (ABEE), a solution concept proposed by Jehiel [2005], is the most closely related to\nours.51 In ABEE, agents first group the set of opponents\u2019 decision nodes into a partition, namely, an\nanalogy class. Next, they form expectations of each opponent\u2019s average behavior at every element of\nthe analogy class rather than, more precisely, at each decision node. Although conceptually, ABEE\nis similar to CE, when applied to a different type of games, ABEE also suggests that individuals\nmight not fully consider how others\u2019 choices depend on their information, and such deficiency in\nreasoning is common knowledge among all players.52 By contrast, our model allows NLK players to\nconsider heterogeneity in their opponents\u2019 inference process. In our adaptation of NLK equilibrium\nto dynamic games, beliefs about different types of opponents are\n\nanchored at the beginning of the game and are updated at each stage using Bayes\u2019 rule. Analyti-\ncally, ABEE coincides with SPNE for the finest analogy partition, and similar to NLK, ABEE can\nalso rationalize passing, in the centipede game, to the last few stages for a large range of partitions,\nin violation of the backward induction predictions. However, ABEE does not provide a specific\nmeans to choose an analogy class, whereas NLK offers a means of parametric estimation to specify\nbeliefs in equilibrium.53\n\nAs with all of the aforementioned solution concepts, NLK maintains the best response to beliefs\nbut relaxes NE\u2019s requirement of a player\u2019s consistent beliefs about other players. In dynamic games,\n[Aumann, 1992], similar to several other writers in the subsequent literature, has shown that a\nfailure of backward induction does not imply a failure of individual rationality. For example, in\nthe centipede game, backward induction implies that the first mover ought to use stop at the first\ndecision node, which has rarely been demonstrated in experimental data. These papers show that\n\n51 Jehiel and Koessler [2008]) extends his analogy-based concept to Bayesian games.\n52More specifically, information means the history upon reaching a decision node at which the choice is made.\n53As an extension of the Level-K model to dynamic games, Ho and Su [2013] apply their model to the experiment data of\nthe centipede game. However, they intend to study learning across repetitions, whereas ours explains strategic behavior\nbetter even for novel games. Moreover, unlike their model, NLK does not restrict the strategy set, which allows NLK to\ncapture Bayesian updating for beliefs across stages within one round.\n\n\fBridging Level-K to Nash Equilibrium\n\n27\n\nsome relaxations of the \"common knowledge of rationality\" explain several rounds of passing,\nalthough all of the players are individually rational. 54,55\n\n54An individual must be careful about the terminology according to the epistemic condition of NE. Aumann and Bran-\ndenburger [1995] prove that in a two-person game, mutual knowledge of preferences and payoffs, rationality, and beliefs\nregarding the other players\u2019 strategies are sufficient for NE. This common knowledge of rationality is unnecessary for NE\nin a two-person game. Moreover, Battigalli and Bonanno [1999] argue that there is a contradiction between the results\nof backward induction and a common belief in sequential rationality at later stages. Thus, in this paper, by \u201ccommon\nknowledge of rationality,\u201d we mean, in general, the extra assumptions necessary for NE/BNE/SPNE other than individual\nrationality.\n55Aumann [1992] shows that continuation of the game beyond the first node for several rounds could occur even with\n\u201cmutual knowledge\u201d of high degrees.

We study turn-based multiplayer non zero-sum games played on \ufb01nite\ngraphs with quantitative reachability objectives, continuing work initiated in [BBDP10]. In\nthis framework each player aims at reaching his own goal as soon as possible.

In particular, in the present framework of games on graphs, it is very natural\nto consider the notion of subgame perfect equilibrium [Sel65]: a choice of strategies is not\nonly required to be a Nash equilibrium from the initial vertex, but also after every possible\ninitial history of the game.

In general, for a strategy profile to be a SPE, it must not only be an NE but also constitute optimal responses after any history of play. Thus, while every SPE is an NE, the converse holds under specific conditions.

  "output": "{\"title\":\"Equivalence of Subgame Perfect Equilibria and Nash Equilibria in Infinite Games\",\"summary\":\"In infinite games, the relationship between subgame perfect equilibria (SPE) and Nash equilibria (NE) is nuanced. In general, for a strategy profile to be a SPE, it must not only be an NE but also constitute optimal responses after any history of play. Thus, while every SPE is an NE, the converse holds under specific conditions. Particularly, in finite or certain structured infinite games, if the game possesses the finite property (finite lookahead) or certain convergence properties, NE might coincide with SPE. Conversely, if players are allowed infinite deviations or changes in strategies without a limit on the timeline, the equivalence may break down, leading to scenarios where SPE does not exist. Overall, the conditions under which SPE also acts as NE in infinite games hinge on the structure and rules of the game, especially regarding the continuity and boundedness of strategies.\",\"references\":[{\"title\":\"Bridging Level-K to Nash Equilibrium\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12292v2\"},{\"title\":\"On (Subgame Perfect) Secure Equilibrium in Quantitative Reachability Games\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6346v3\"}]}"
