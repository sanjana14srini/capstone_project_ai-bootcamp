Specifically, our approach takes into account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable model.

To contrast the invisible impact that AI is having on the limited resources\nof our planet, the field of Green AI [2] rapidly developed, and has seen a considerable growth in the\nmost recent years [3]. By quoting the words of Schwartz et al. [2], Green AI is a field of AI research\nthat yields novel results while considering its computational cost and encouraging the reduction of\nresources spent. Under the research field of Green AI fall a plethora of heterogeneous solutions, ranging\nfrom ad hoc hyperparameter tuning to trade-offs between model accuracy and energy consumption,\nenergy-aware model deployment strategies, data-centric techniques [3], and software engineering\napproaches [4]. Despite the wide array of Green AI solutions that have been conceived to date, Green AI\napproaches based on selecting different models by factoring in their energy consumption results to date\nto be an uncharted territory. In this work, we explore the potential that dynamic model selection based\non the task at hand, model validation accuracy, and energy efficiency can have on AI environmental\nsustainability. More specifically, we present the very idea of Green AI dynamic model selection by\npresenting two methods that lend their core intuition from the related literature on dynamic model\nselection, namely model cascading and model routing [5, 6].

              "summary": "Artificial Intelligence is increasingly pervasive across domains, with ever more complex models delivering impressive predictive performance. This fast technological advancement however comes at a concerning environmental cost, with state-of-the-art models - particularly deep neural networks and large language models - requiring substantial computational resources and energy. In this work, we present the intuition of Green AI dynamic model selection, an approach based on dynamic model selection that aims at reducing the environmental footprint of AI by selecting the most sustainable model while minimizing potential accuracy loss. Specifically, our approach takes into account the inference task, the environmental sustainability of available models, and accuracy requirements to dynamically choose the most suitable model. Our approach presents two different methods, namely Green AI dynamic model cascading and Green AI dynamic model routing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via a proof of concept empirical example based on a real-world dataset. Our results show that Green AI dynamic model selection can achieve substantial energy savings (up to ~25%) while substantially retaining the accuracy of the most energy greedy solution (up to ~95%). As conclusion, our preliminary findings highlight the potential that hybrid, adaptive model selection strategies withhold to mitigate the energy demands of modern AI systems without significantly compromising accuracy requirements.",

Introduction\n\nThe popularization of AI models, ranging from simple classifiers to complex large language models, has\ntaken the world by storm. With the widespread and evergrowing adoption of AI and all the benefits\nit implied, the environmental resources needed to power such models is also surging, and this trend\nis no longer negligible [1]. To contrast the invisible impact that AI is having on the limited resources\nof our planet, the field of Green AI [2] rapidly developed, and has seen a considerable growth in the\nmost recent years [3]. By quoting the words of Schwartz et al. [2], Green AI is a field of AI research\nthat yields novel results while considering its computational cost and encouraging the reduction of\nresources spent. Under the research field of Green AI fall a plethora of heterogeneous solutions, ranging\nfrom ad hoc hyperparameter tuning to trade-offs between model accuracy and energy consumption,\nenergy-aware model deployment strategies, data-centric techniques [3], and software engineering\napproaches [4]. Despite the wide array of Green AI solutions that have been conceived to date, Green AI\napproaches based on selecting different models by factoring in their energy consumption results to date\nto be an uncharted territory. In this work, we explore the potential that dynamic model selection based\non the task at hand, model validation accuracy, and energy efficiency can have on AI environmental\nsustainability. More specifically, we present the very idea of Green AI dynamic model selection by\npresenting two methods that lend their core intuition from the related literature on dynamic model\nselection, namely model cascading and model routing [5, 6]. Intuitively the first method we present,\nnamely Green AI dynamic model cascading, subsequently invokes different models from less to more\nenergy greedy till a sufficient level of prediction confidence is achieved. The second method instead,\n\nGreen-Aware AI 2025 @ ECAI 2025\n$ emilio.cruciani@unier.it (E. Cruciani); roberto.verdecchia@unifi.it (R.

The empirical proof of concept, which should be by no means\nbe interpreted as exhaustive or conclusive, is based on an exemplary classification task relying on\nthe widely utilized scikit-learn and keras Python libraries, two AI models of different complexity, and\nan ad hoc implementation of the energy-aware dynamic model cascading and routing methods. The\npreliminary results we collect point to the potential that dynamic model selection methods have to\nachieve Green AI. As a complementary portion of our contribution, we also delve into reflecting on the\nvarious nuances, potential challenges, and benefits that may arise when building further onto the Green\nAI dynamic model selection approach.\n\n2. Related Work\n\nThe field of Green AI has experienced a swift growth in popularization in the past few years and is\nincreasingly becoming an established discipline [3]. The rise of interest in the topic could have stemmed\nfrom diverse effort of the research community to quantify the environmental impact of AI, ranging from\ngeneric high level figures of CO2 emissions [7] to fine-grained measurements of specific models, e.g.,\ndeep learning ones [8]. The overall picture studies of this nature draw is consistent, the environmental\nimpact of AI is an issue that needs to be addressed. Answering such call, numerous research endeavors\nfocused on improving the energy efficiency "

However, whale researchers observe that this is exactly\nwhat commercial whale hunting expeditions did to catch whales.\nThus, commercial whale hunting a.k.a. whaling data could be used\nfor altruistic purposes by using it to estimate changes in whale\npopulations across the oceans over time.\n\nHowever, commercial whaling data cannot be easily repurposed\nto infer the spatial distribution of whales.

For example, whalers plan out a route they\nwill follow to search for whales; along this route, they may catch\nwhales but they may also leave empty-handed.
