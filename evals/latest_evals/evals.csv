Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision.

Poskitt'], 'published': '2020-07-07T17:40:13Z', 'summary': 'The threats faced by cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure have motivated the development of different attack detection mechanisms, such as those that monitor for violations of invariants, i.e. properties that always hold in normal operation. Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.', 'content': 'nd Magnus Almgren. 2018.

Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.', 'content': 'em A.

With mod-\nern greenhouses equipped with actuation systems such\nas heating, ventilation, and CO2 injection, effective con-\ntrol approaches can lead to high crop yield in an energy-\nefﬁcient manner. However, the control challenge is difﬁ-\ncult as the process dynamics are highly nonlinear and com-\nplex [28], and the climate variables, such as temperature\nand humidity, must be effectively constrained to avoid\ndamage to crops due to, e.g., spread of diseases [6, 34, 11].\nWhile traditional methods, e.g., on-off and PID control,\nhave been used for low-level regulation, these strategies\nare not rooted in optimal control and are in general un-\n\nable to deliver optimal performance and to systematically\nhandle complex state and/or input constraints [12, 15].\n\nModel predictive control (MPC) is an optimization-based\ncontrol methodology that naturally handles multi-input-\nmulti-output systems with state, input, and output con-\nstraints [5]. It has seen huge theoretical success and appli-\ncation in process control, and has been proposed to solve\ngreenhouse control challenges [3, 10, 21]. However, MPC\nrelies heavily on an accurate prediction model, while in a\ngreenhouse prediction model there always exist uncertain-\nties due to, e.g., modeling error and inaccurate weather\nforecasting. For model-based control, an incorrect model\ncan lead the controller to drive the system to an undesired\npoint of operation, possibly violating constraints. Further-\nmore, as constraints often represent the validity range for\nthe accuracy of the prediction model, violations of the con-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cS. Mallick et al.\n\nstraints can lead to degraded performance when applied to\nthe real system [34].\n\nSome existing works have addressed prediction uncer-\ntainty only in the context of external disturbances, such\nas weather predictions [6, 14]. In [8], the uncertainty in\nmarket prices is addressed with a scenario-based stochas-\ntic MPC controller; however, the controller is based on\nmixed-integer optimization, requiring signiﬁcant compu-\ntational efforts. Alternatively,\nthe following existing\nworks have explored uncertainty stemming from an incor-\nrect physical model of the system. In [12], the robustness\nof predictive control for a greenhouse in the presence of\nmodel uncertainties is considered empirically, however no\nmechanism to compensate for the prediction error is intro-\nduced. In [19, 20], a neural network is used as a prediction\nmodel, with a robust MPC controller addressing the pre-\ndiction uncertainty; however, a min-max robust MPC ap-\nproach is used, which is inherent'}, {'id': '2409.12789v3', 'title': 'Reinforcement Learning-based Model Predictive Control for Greenhouse Climate Control', 'authors': ['Samuel Mallick', 'Filippo Airaldi', 'Azita Dabiri', 'Congcong Sun', 'Bart De Schutter'], 'published': '2024-09-19T13:56:34Z', 'summary': 'Greenhouse climate control is concerned with maximizing performance in terms of crop yield and resource efficiency.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces. This system integrates multiple EDA tools, allowing designers to execute complex workflows conversationally. Key features include a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology that utilizes real performance data from post-layout results to refine synthesis processes, enabling significant improvements in timing closure and area reduction.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n\n            Current query: summary of classical vision models\n        "", 'timestamp': '2025-12-18T12:20:11.979238+00:00', 'part_kind': 'user-prompt'}], 'instructions': 'You are a helpful assistant that answers user questions only based on arxiv research articles.\n\n        When a user asks a query, you always summarize the query using the generate_summary tool.\n        Then you search the index to find relevant results. \n        If you cannot find anything relevant, then you fetch the relevant articles from arxiv using the get_data_to_index tool.\n        Then you perfrom a search using the search tool again.\n\n        You always call the search_quality_check tool after searching the index to evaluate the quality of the retrieved search results.\n        If the search_quality_check tool indicates ""More data is needed"", then you may perform additional search using the suggested_search_terms.\n\n        You provide a complete and correct answer to the user\'s question by summarizing all these search results.

We are conﬁdent that the proposed\ncategories are wide enough to conceptualize existent methods,\nhowever due to the growing speed of the ﬁeld they could\nrequire future updates. As will be shown in the coming sec-\ntions, the strategies used during the last 20 years are very\nheterogeneous. Therefore, rather than provide a comparative\nstructure between existing methods and features, the objective\nof this paper is to highlight common points of interest and\nrelevant future lines of research. The bibliography presented in\nthis paper is mainly in FPV. However, some particular works\nin classic video analysis are also mentioned to support the\nanalysis. The latter are cited using italic font as a visual cue.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only paper summarizing\nthe general ideas of the FPV is [18], which presents a wear-\nable device and several possible applications. Other related\nreviews include the following: [19] reviews the activity recog-\nnition methods with multiple sensors; [20] analyzes the use of\nwearable cameras for medical applications; [3] presents some\nchallenges of an active wearable device.\n\nIn the remainder of this paper, we summarize existent methods\nin FPV, according to a hierarchical structure we propose, high-\nlighting the more relevant works and the temporal evolution\nof the ﬁeld. Section 2 introduces general characteristics of FPV\nand the hierarchical structure, which is later used to summarize\nthe current methods according to their ﬁnal objective, the sub-\n\n2\n\ntasks performed and the features used. In section 3 we brieﬂy\npresent the publicly-available FPV datasets. Finally, section 4\ndiscusses some future challenges and research opportunities in\nthis ﬁeld.\n\n2 FIRST PERSON VISION (FPV) VIDEO ANALYSIS\n\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, the advances in FPV\nanalysis were mainly performed using highly elaborated de-\nvices, typically proprietarily developed by different research\ngroups. The list of devices proposed is wide, where each de-\nvice was usually presented in conjunction with their potential\napplications and a large array of sensors which only envy\nfrom modern devices in their design, size and commercial\ncapabilities. The column “Hardware” in Table 2 summarizes\nthese devices. The remaining columns of this table are ex-\nplained in section 2.1. Nowadays, current devices could be\nconsidered as the embodiment of the futuristic perspective of\nthe already mentioned pioneering studies. Table 1 shows the\ncurrently available commercial projects and their embedded\nsensors. Such devices are grouped in three categories:\n\n• Smart-glasses: Smart-glasses have multiple sensors, pro-\ncessing capabilities and a head-up display, making them\nideal to develop real time methods and to improve the\ninteraction between the user and its device. Besides, smart-\nglasses are nowadays seen as the starting point of an\naugmented reality system. However, they cannot be con-\nsidered a mature product until major challenges, such\nas battery life, price and target market, are solved. The\nfuture of these devices is promising, but it is still not\nclear if they will be adopted by the users on a daily basis\nlike smartphones, or whether they will become special-\nized task-oriented devices like industrial glasses, smart-\nhelmets, sport devices, etc.\n\n• Action cameras: commonly used by sportsmen and lifel-\noggers. However, the research community has been using\nthem as a tool to develop methods and algorithms while\nanticipating the commercial availability of\nthe smart-\nglasses during the coming years. Action cameras are be-\ncoming cheaper, and are starting to exhibit (albeit still\nsomewhat limited) processing capabilities.\n\n• Eye trackers: have been successfully applied to analyze\nconsumer behaviors in commercial environments. Proto-\ntypes are available mainly for research purposes, where\nmultiple applications have been proposed in conjunction\nwith FPV. Despite the potential of these devices, their pop-\nularity is highly affected by the price of their components\nand the obtrusiveness of the eye tracker sensors, which is\ncommonly carried out using an eye pointing camera.\n\nFPV video analysis gives some methodological and practical\nadvantages, but also inherently brings a set of challenges\nthat need to be addressed [18]. On one hand, FPV solves\nsome problems of the classical video analysis and offers extra\ninformation:\n\n• Videos of the main part of the scene: Wearable devices allow\nthe user to (even unknowingly) record the most relevant\nparts of the scene for the analysis, thus reducing the\nnecessity for complex controlled multi-camera systems\n[23].\n\n\x0c3\n\n[12] Steve Mann presents some\nexperim'}, {'id': '1409.1484v3', 'title': 'The Evolution of First Person Vision Methods: A Survey', 'authors': ['Alejandro Betancourt', 'Pietro Morerio', 'Carlo S.

The list of devices proposed is wide, where each de-\nvice was usually presented in conjunction with their potential\napplications and a large array of sensors which only envy\nfrom modern devices in their design, size and commercial\ncapabilities. The column “Hardware” in Table 2 summarizes\nthese devices. The remaining columns of this table are ex-\nplained in section 2.1. Nowadays, current devices could be\nconsidered as the embodiment of the futuristic perspective of\nthe already mentioned pioneering studies. Table 1 shows the\ncurrently available commercial projects and their embedded\nsensors. Such devices are grouped in three categories:\n\n• Smart-glasses: Smart-glasses have multiple sensors, pro-\ncessing capabilities and a head-up display, making them\nideal to develop real time methods and to improve the\ninteraction between the user and its device. Besides, smart-\nglasses are nowadays seen as the starting point of an\naugmented reality system. However, they cannot be con-\nsidered a mature product until major challenges, such\nas battery life, price and target market, are solved. The\nfuture of these devices is promising, but it is still not\nclear if they will be adopted by the users on a daily basis\nlike smartphones, or whether they will become special-\nized task-oriented devices like industrial glasses, smart-\nhelmets, sport devices, etc.\n\n• Action cameras: commonly used by sportsmen and lifel-\noggers. However, the research community has been using\nthem as a tool to develop methods and algorithms while\nanticipating the commercial availability of\nthe smart-\nglasses during the coming years. Action cameras are be-\ncoming cheaper, and are starting to exhibit (albeit still\nsomewhat limited) processing capabilities.\n\n• Eye trackers: have been successfully applied to analyze\nconsumer behaviors in commercial environments. Proto-\ntypes are available mainly for research purposes, where\nmultiple applications have been proposed in conjunction\nwith FPV. Despite the potential of these devices, their pop-\nularity is highly affected by the price of their components\nand the obtrusiveness of the eye tracker sensors, which is\ncommonly carried out using an eye pointing camera.\n\nFPV video analysis gives some methodological and practical\nadvantages, but also inherently brings a set of challenges\nthat need to be addressed [18]. On one hand, FPV solves\nsome problems of the classical video analysis and offers extra\ninformation:\n\n• Videos of the main part of the scene: Wearable devices allow\nthe user to (even unknowingly) record the most relevant\nparts of the scene for the analysis, thus reducing the\nnecessity for complex controlled multi-camera systems\n[23].\n\n\x0c3\n\n[12] Steve Mann presents some\nexperim'}, {'id': '1409.1484v3', 'title': 'The Evolution of First Person Vision Methods: A Survey', 'authors': ['Alejandro Betancourt', 'Pietro Morerio', 'Carlo S.

Here are three notable contributions:\n\n1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This paper introduces a novel method that integrates LoRA with federated learning (FL) to address the challenges of Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces. This system integrates multiple EDA tools, allowing designers to execute complex workflows conversationally. Key features include a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology that utilizes real performance data from post-layout results to refine synthesis processes, enabling significant improvements in timing closure and area reduction.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision.

Research focused on caretaking in child-robot interactions\nis limited, however some studies reported children spontaneously\ndemonstrating robot care behaviors. For example, a social robot was\ndeployed in an early childhood education center for five months,\nand toddlers showed more caretaking behaviors for the robot (such\nas putting a blanket on the robot while saying “night-night”) than\nother objects such as an immobile robotic toy, treating the care-\nreceiving robot as a peer [36]. As part of their findings, Tanaka et al.\n[36] reported a set of factors that impacted the quality of children’s\ninteraction with the robot, including caretaking, rough-housing,\nhugging, touching the robot with objects, or touching the robot’s\nhead, face, trunk, arm, hand, leg, or foot. These factors manifested\n\nin children’s behaviors differently depending on the robot, for ex-\nample, violent rough-housing was observed only for the immobile\nrobotic toy, while children frequently hugged the care-receiving ro-\nbot. Tanaka and Kimura [37] explains that such care activities are a\npart of children’s development of learning by teaching. They argued\nthat, the robot being a “weaker” entity than the children, in size\nand sophistication, motivated children’s care interactions with the\nrobot in the classroom. However, research exploring caretaking in\nchild-robot interactions are typically limited to a classroom context\nand the literature lacks insight into how robot caretaking might\nbe formed in children’s homes. While our work is also situated in\na laboratory context, we aim to extract initial design factors for\nchildren’s robot caretaking tasks that would later be transferable\nto the home setting.\n\nLong Term Child-Robot Interactions. The design of social robots\nthat can sustain long-term interactions with children is key for\nexploring how children would take care of a robot in their homes.\nHowever, human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers [9, 10, 41]\nas well as companies that have developed social robots (e.g., Jibo,\nAnki, Kuri) have continued to face barriers to sustaining long-term\nhuman-robot interactions.

In this paper, we explore the activity\nof caretaking of a social robot as a new and unique responsibility\nintroduced by in-home, long-term interactions with a robot. Care-\ntaking might range from maintaining the robot by charging and\ncleaning, protecting it by providing a shelter and a safe space, or\nproviding companionship by chatting, playing games, or reading\ntogether. It also serves as a new and exciting design space with\nthe potential to craft a positive user experience that facilitates the\nforming of lasting bond between the child and the robot.\n\nSimilar to a friendship between two people or the connection\nbetween a person and a real or artificial pet (e.g., the Tamagotchi in\na key-chain form[22]), we aim to explore how meaningful, lasting\ninterpersonal connections might be formed between children and\nrobots by designing a robot capable of also receiving care [37] rather\nthan simply giving care. Prior research has shown that caring for\nan interactive toy, robot, or chatbot by comforting [18], teaching\n[23], or touching [34] it can help form stronger connections and\nfacilitate positive outcomes such as improvements in mental health\nin adults [18], learning gains in children [23], and the amount of\ntime adults spent on a monotonous task [34]. Building on these\nfindings, we posit that the key to developing a social companion\nrobot for families, particularly for children, that overcomes barriers\nto successful long-term human-robot interaction is the formation of\nlasting interpersonal connections between the robot and its users.\nWe explore how designing a robot that is capable of receiving care\nfrom its users might facilitate the forming of such relationships.\nOur work aims to address the following questions:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cIDC ’22, June 27–30, 2022, Braga, Portugal\n\nBengisu Cagiltay, Joseph Michaelis, Sarah Sebo, and Bilge Mutlu\n\nFigure 1: Children reading to the robot for a bedtime care routine: In this study we explored children’s preferences for taking\ncare of a social robot and conducted a feasibility study to evaluate children’s experience of taking care of a robot.

How can we design robot caretaking tasks with children\nto foster interpersonal connections and long-term use of\nthe robot?\n\nAs a first step toward addressing these questions, we conducted\nan exploratory design study that explored what types of caretaking\ntasks children would prefer and how these care obligations would\nfit in their daily routines. We then conducted a brief feasibility\nstudy that tested two types of caretaking tasks and measured how\nchildren perceived the robot and how close they felt to the robot\nafter completing the care tasks. This work makes the following\ncontributions.\n\n(1) A characterization of caretaking as a design space for child-\n\nrobot interaction design;\n\n(2) An understanding of children’s preferences for robot caretak-\n\ning activities;\n\n(3) A preliminary understanding of children’s perceptions of\n\ndesigned caretaking interactions.\n\n2 BACKGROUND\n\nCaretaking in Child-Robot Interactions. Limited work shows how\npeople can benefit from expressing care towards non-robot applica-\ntions, such as chatbots. For example, people whom interacted with a\ncare-receiving chatbot by comforting it had increased positive men-\ntal health outcomes in self-compassion [18]. In another study [32], a\nsocial robot deployed in the workspace for 10 work days was found\nmore effective in helping users better manage their breaks.

Self-adaptive software is introduced in Section II-A.\nSection II-B briefly gives an overview of ICT technologies\napplied in healthcare fields, and IoT and AI-related healthcare\nstudies for childhood obesity are introduced.\n\nA. Self-Adaptive Software\n\nSelf-adaptive software aims to autonomously adjust its vari-\nous attributes in response to the detected context [12]. Context\nrefers to various environmental factors that can potentially\naffect the software. Self-adaptive software requires continuous\nmonitoring and adaptation to the context changes; thus, an\nadaptation cycle is required, and the cycle is called MAPE\nloop. MAPE loop is generally applied in self-adaptive software\nand consists of four processes [12]:\n\n• Monitoring, which is responsible for collecting data from\n\nthe software and operating environment.\n\n• Analyzing (detecting), which is responsible for analyzing\nthe symptoms using data from the monitoring process.\n• Planning (deciding), which is responsible for deciding\nhow to change artifacts or attributes to improve perfor-\nmance.\n\n• Executing (acting), which is responsible for applying\n\nchanges.\n\nThe concept of self-adaptive software is applied in various\nfields such as healthcare [13], smart farming [14], smart homes\n[15], and smart buildings [16]. In this study, it is assumed that\nhealth conditions of children can be continuously changed\nand require adaptation to respond to these health changes.\nTherefore, the concept of self-adaptive software was applied\nto manage childhood healthcare.\n\nB. AI and IoT Applied in Healthcare Domain\n\nThe integration of AI and IoT is revolutionizing healthcare\n[4], [17]. In several studies, IoT sensors including medical de-\nvices (e.g., force, heart rate, pulse oximetry, pressure, glucose,\ntemperature, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and elec-\ntroencephalogram), smartphones (e.g., gyroscope, accelerom-\neter, and microphone), and wearable devices were developed\nand used to collect healthcare-related data via the Internet\n[6], [17].

However, there are \ntwo additional factors that may be of particular importance to practitioners. \nThe ﬁrst is the morphology, or form, of the robot itself. Robots can range in \nappearance from very mechanical-looking to very anthropomorphic in \nappearance (Riek, Rabinowitch, Chakrabarti, & Robinson, 2009). \nMorphology is a richly debated topic in the research community, with many \nstudies showing people will anthropomorphize and form attachments to \nnearly anything conveying animacy. Some researchers worry this not only \nconveys inaccurate expectations to people about a robot’s capabilities, but \nmay also be unethical when treating vulnerable populations (Riek, Hartzog, \nHoward, Moon, & Calo, 2015; Riek & Howard, 2014). For example, \nindividuals with cognitive impairments or children may be more susceptible \nto deception and manipulation by robots. \n\nA second factor that can impact the HRI problem is individual differences \nbetween people. People have a wide range of existing cognitive and physical \nattributes which can greatly inﬂuence how they perceive, interact with, and \naccept robots (Hayes & Riek, 2014). These factors may be particularly \nimportant when considering the use of robotics technology for clients in \nmental healthcare settings, who may have further unique needs. \n\n© 2016 Laurel Riek.

Understanding\nthe factors inﬂuencing obesity is very complex since there are\nmany variables that can affect the health behaviors leading\nto it. Nowadays, multiple data sources can be used to study\nhealth behaviors, such as wearable sensors for physical activity\nand sleep, social media, mobile and health data. In this paper\nwe describe the design of a dashboard for the visualization of\nactigraphy and biometric data from a childhood obesity camp\nin Qatar. This dashboard allows quantitative discoveries that\ncan be used to guide patient behavior and orient qualitative\nresearch.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nChildhood obesity is a growing epidemic, and with tech-\nnological advancements, new tools can be used to monitor\nand analyze lifestyle factors leading to obesity, which in\nturn can help in timely health behavior modiﬁcations. In\nthis paper we present a tool for visualization of personal\nhealth data, which can assist healthcare professionals in\ndesigning personalized interventions for improving health.\nThe data used for the tool was collected as part of a\nresearch project called ”Adaptive Cognitive Behavioral Ap-\nproach to Addressing Overweight and Obesity among Qatari\nYouth” (ICAN Study)[1]. The participants in the study\nwere involved in activities aimed at improving their health\nbehavior and losing weight. All participants and their par-\nents/guardians provided informed consent prior to partici-\npation. Data from various sources (social media, mobile,\nwearables and health records) were collected from subjects\nand linked using a unique subject identiﬁer. These datasets\nprovided what we have deﬁned as a 360-degree Quantiﬁed\nSelf (360QS) view of individuals [2], [3].\n\nWe have focused on the visualization of the biometrics\nand physical activity data. We discuss different visualization\ntechniques used to analyze the activity patterns of partic-\nipants in the obesity trial. Our dashboard is designed to\ncompare data across time, and among reference individuals.\n\nII. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DASHBOARD\n\nA. Data Handling\n\nBiometric data were measured periodically and included\nheight, weight and the derived body-mass index (BMI), body\n\nfat percentage, waist circumference and blood pressure for\neach individual. Physical activity data was collected via\naccelerometers. The raw signals have been quantized into\nfour activity levels: sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous,\nusing a human activity recognition algorithm [4].\n\nB. Visualization\n\nThe objective of the dashboard is to provide an overview\nof the actigraphy data and enable primary data exploration\nby an expert user. Referring to ﬁgure 1, the interface is made\nup of a Control Panel (left side) and a Visualization Panel\n(right side).\n\nIn the Control Panel, drop down menus enable selecting\ntwo subjects to be compared based on identiﬁers and gender;\ne.g., boys number 84 (top) and 82 (bottom) are displayed.\nDuring data collection, some devices were not worn at\nall times; hence they recorded long periods of ”sedentary”\nactivity. The user can use a slider to ﬁlter out days with\nmore than the selected number of sedentary hours. Finally,\nthe user can use check-boxes to select the biometrics she\nwants to compare (e.g., BMI and Body Fat Percentage).\n\nThe Visualization Panel shows both subjects, one at the\ntop in a box with orange frame and the other at the bottom\nin a box with violet frame.

By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961v3)\n\n2. **LoRA Done RITE**: This work addresses the lack of transformation invariance in current LoRA optimizers, which leads to inefficient learning. The authors propose LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method that ensures invariant weight updates regardless of how LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. Extensive experiments show that this approach yields consistent accuracy gains across various large language model tasks.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces. This system integrates multiple EDA tools, allowing designers to execute complex workflows conversationally. Key features include a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology that utilizes real performance data from post-layout results to refine synthesis processes, enabling significant improvements in timing closure and area reduction. The structured framework consists of an MCP Server and Clients that facilitate dynamic tool orchestration and stateful workflow management, making it adaptable to design needs. \n\n## References\n- [MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol RTL-to-GDSII Automation with Backend Aware Synthesis Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19570v1)\n when is sub-game perfect equilibria also a nash equilibria in an infinite game? # Sub-game Perfect Equilibria and Nash Equilibria in Infinite Games\n\n## Summary \n In infinite games, sub-game perfect equilibria can also be Nash equilibria under certain conditions related to time-inconsistency and player preferences. Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision. Recent research has highlighted the following key aspects of FPV and its methods:\n\n1. **FPV Video Analysis**: This approach captures videos from the user's perspective, allowing for better context in tasks such as object detection and activity recognition. It has shifted the focus towards understanding user interactions and behaviors.\n\n2. **Emergence of Wearable Devices**: Smart glasses and action cameras have become vital tools. They include multiple sensing capabilities that can enhance real-time analysis and interaction, offering significant advantages over traditional systems.\n\n3. **Methodological Advances**: Various image features and computational techniques are combined in innovative ways to address challenges unique to FPV, making it a rich area for both research and commercial applications.\n\n4. **Future Directions**: Continuous advances in technology suggest that the field will further develop, with smart wearable devices poised to play a crucial role in the next generation of vision systems.

We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city.

We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms.

Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  ‘Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext’. We also wish to gratefully acknowledge \nthe permission given to us by the Archaeological \nSurvey of India to survey Dholavira in 2007, 2008 \nand  2010.   Without  this  it  would  have  been  im-\npossible to carry out our research.

We  wish  to  thank  Professor \nVasant Shinde for his continuing encouragement; \nProfessor  Sir  Arnold  Wolfendale  for  useful  sug-\ngestions;  and  Nisha  Yadav  for  her  helpful  input \nduring this research. Finally,  we are  particularly \ngrateful to  Professor Wayne Orchiston for  all of \nthe  effort  he  took  to  make  the  contents  of  this \npaper precise and clear. \n\n6  REFERENCES \nAgrawal, D.P., 2007.

It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms. Upon assuming strategically-placed holes in their ceilings we examine the internal movement of sunlight within these rooms and suggest that the larger structure of which they formed a part could have functioned as an astronomical observatory.', 'content': 'fication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  ‘Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext’.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision.

A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms. In this work, we propose a computational method for assessing politicization in online conversations based on topic shifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in online conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives.

However, we highlight sig-\nnificant differences. Namely, increased cohesion\nconcerning themes in general (keywords) and pre-\nNakba village context. This connects to two factors\nthat influence group memory. First, the constructed\nsocial and cultural roles of gender among Pales-\ntinians in refugee camps, and second, the nature\nof refugee camps as spaces of displacement and\nvulnerability, which operate under unique socio-\neconomic constraints that profoundly shape gen-\nder dynamics. Second, pre-Nakba, villages were\nclosely knit communities where women’s roles and\nresponsibilities were shaped by communal prac-\ntices and survival strategies, including support-\ning resistance (Sayigh, 2007; Tamari, 2008; Nimr,\n2008; Yahya, 2017). In these settings, women often\ninternalized dominant national narratives shaped\nby the era, which laid the foundation for their role\nin the broader narrative of resistance (Tamari, 2008;\nSayigh, 1998; Yahya, 2017).\n\nWomen’s factual cohesion appears strongest\nwhen referencing specific landmarks or entities in\ntranscripts. This can be associated with their emo-\ntional connection to physical places. In contrast,\nmen’s narratives exhibit notable divergence in their\ndescriptions of landmarks, families, and other en-\ntities. This suggests that men’s experiences are ei-\nther more individualized or less influenced by com-\nmunal memory practices. Sayigh’s ethnography\ncorroborates this, highlighting men’s fragmented\nrecollections shaped by personal trajectories and\ninteractions with political and economic systems\n(Sayigh, 1998, 2015).\n\nOverall, our findings challenge the notion that\nsame-gender pairs inherently produce cohesive nar-\nratives (Tamari, 2008; Nimr, 2008; Sayigh, 2015,\n1998).\nInstead, cohesion reflects the collective\nmemory fostered by women’s roles in village life\nand under colonial rule, even as factual details vary.\n\nbound by the scope of POHA which focuses solely\non Lebanon and offers a preliminary foray into one\nmeans of capturing multidimensional narrative co-\nhesion in an archive. With these findings, we hope\nto both reaffirm and extend prior scholarship on\nPalestinian collective memory, by providing empir-\nical evidence of how oral narratives allow refugees\nto build continuity and counteract the violent frag-\nmentation of Palestinian society after the Nakba.\n\nLimitations\n\nFrom a substantive standpoint, the analysis and\ninterviews (which represent just a fraction of the\nPalestinian refugee population in Lebanon) provide\nonly a partial perspective on the Nakba. Captur-\ning the depth of this historical tragedy in a single\nanalysis is inherently difficult, especially when the\nNakba remains an ongoing condition of exile.\n\nOur analysis uses mixed effects models to ex-\nplore the relationship between cohesion and com-\nmunity membership; here, we identify assumptions\nthat may not be robust. Although we tried a trian-\ngulation approach with different aspects, the tex-\ntual representations are limited in capturing nar-\nrative structure. Generally, our focused approach\nonly begins to characterize POHA. Future research\ncould explore other methods for understanding oral\nhistory archives, complementing interpretive ap-\nproaches that engage directly with individual inter-\nviews. In addition, the metadata results in this pa-\nper partly reflect curation decisions by the POHA\nteam. Archivists’ positionality often influences\ndescriptive practices (King, 2024; Carbajal and\nCaswell, 2021), introducing potential bias in meta-\ndata terminology. Discrete metadata fields also risk\nreducing the rich lived experiences in interviews\nto simplified categories, although we use semantic\nembeddings to counteract these limitations.\n\n7 Conclusion\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis paper constitutes a large-scale computational\nanalysis of an oral history archive of the Nakba\nusing natural language processing.

Here are three notable contributions:\n\n1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This paper introduces a novel method that integrates LoRA with federated learning (FL) to address the challenges of Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency.

The authors propose LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method that ensures invariant weight updates regardless of how LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. Extensive experiments show that this approach yields consistent accuracy gains across various large language model tasks.

By automating the identification of optimal module types for placing LoRA adapters, PLoP enhances the finetuning process for large models. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional placement strategies through comprehensive testing across various tasks.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces. This system integrates multiple EDA tools, allowing designers to execute complex workflows conversationally.

The only other work addressing a convergence problem is [2], which studies a time-inconsistent\nmean-field Markov decision game in discrete time and shows that the mean-field equilibrium provides an approximate\noptimal strategy when applied to the corresponding N -player game, but only in a precommitment sense. This\nresult does not contradict ours because it considers time-inconsistency arising from non-exponential discounting,\nwhereas we focus on mean–variance type preferences. We show that, under the assumption of uniqueness of the\nsub-game–perfect mean-field equilibrium, the BSDE system describing the N -player game converges to the McKean–\nVlasov BSDE associated with the mean-field game. In this context, the existence and uniqueness of the sub-game–\nperfect mean-field equilibrium is equivalent to the well-posedness of the McKean–Vlasov BSDE described in (4.3), or\nequivalently (4.4). Given the nature of this BSDE, in which both the driving Brownian motion and the underlying\nprobability measure are part of the solution, together with quadratic growth, proving existence and uniqueness is\nchallenging in general. However, in the mean–variance setting, the system is finite-dimensional, which makes it\nmore tractable. In contrast, non-exponential discounting leads to an infinite-dimensional BSDE system, as shown\nin [36, Theorem 3.10 and Theorem 3.12], where well-posedness is expected to be extremely difficult to obtain. We\nbelieve this may be one of the fundamental reasons for the potential convergence failure highlighted by [2];\n\n(ii) from the bounds in (5.1) and (5.2) for the value processes and for the sub-game–perfect equilibria, respectively, we\ncan additionally derive quantitative convergence rates. The key observation is that the constants C appearing in\nboth estimates depend only on the parameters of the game and are independent of N . Consequently, the convergence\nrates are entirely determined by the behaviour of the functions η and γ. More precisely, the function η originates\nfrom the estimates in (5.40) and takes the form\n\nη(ω, u, N ) := R2\nN\n\n1 + ∥X 1\n\nu(ω)∥2 +\n\n1\nN\n\nN\nX\n\nℓ=1\n\n!\n\n∥X ℓ\n\nu(ω)∥2\n\n+ CN R2\nN\n\n1 + ∥X 1\n\nu(ω)∥2 ¯p +\n\n!\n\n∥X ℓ\n\nu(ω)∥2 ¯p\n\n1\nN\n\nN\nX\n\nℓ=1\n\n+ N R4\nN\n\n1 +\n\n1\nN\n\nN\nX\n\nℓ=1\n\n!\n\n∥X ℓ\n\nu(ω)∥2\n\n(1 + N ), (ω, u, N ) ∈ Ω × [0, T ] × N⋆,\n\nwhere ¯p is introduced in Assumption 5.1.(xi). If there is no interaction through the strategies, then, as already\ndiscussed in Theorem 5.2.(i), the function RN vanishes, and consequently so does η.

How-\never, data from a single device may not be sufficient for\nthis purpose, and fine-tuning often involves multiple de-\nvices that collectively hold the necessary data. This multi-\ndevice setup can raise privacy concerns, as fine-tuning with\ndata from multiple parties may expose sensitive informa-\ntion. Federated Learning (FL) [26] offers a feasible solution\nto this issue. By enabling collaborative learning without\nrequiring data sharing, FL allows participants to fine-tune\nmodels while addressing privacy concerns effectively.\n\nCompared to studies on LoRA fine-tuning in central-\nized settings, fine-tuning LoRA within a FL environment re-\nmains relatively unexplored and presents unique challenges.\nIn this paper, we investigate traditional FL in conjunction\nwith parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, specifically\nfocusing on LoRA. We argue that fine-tuning LoRA mod-\nules presents two key challenges. First, which we refer to\nas the Challenge 1: Server-Side Aggregation Bias, arises\nbecause averaging the LoRA components (A and B) in-\ndependently at the server does not capture the ideal global\nupdate, potentially introducing noise into the aggregated\nmodel. Second, Challenge 2: Client-Side Initialization\nLag highlights the importance of properly allocating global\nupdates to each client’s pre-trained model and LoRA mod-\nules at the start of the next local training phase to ensure a\nconsistent initialization and mitigate initialization lag. Ex-\nisting FL methods for fine-tuning fail to consider these two\nkey points simultaneously. While some methods, such as\nFLoRA [42], attempt to address Challenge 1 by altering the\naggregation process, they fail to address Challenge 2, which\nlimits the performance to a level comparable to that of di-\nrectly combining FedAvg and LoRA (i.e., FedIT [46]).\n\nTaking both Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 into consider-\nation simultaneously is essential for maximizing the perfor-\nmance of LoRA fine-tuning in a federated learning setting.\nIn this work, we propose a simple yet effective method,\nLoRA-FAIR (short for LoRA with Federated Aggregation\nand Initialization Refinement), designed to tackle both chal-\nlenges concurrently. Specifically, we propose that, on the\nserver side, the original averaged LoRA modules (e.g., ¯A\nand ¯B) be kept fixed while introducing a correction term\n∆B to ¯B. This way, the product of the fine-tuned ¯B + ∆B\nand ¯A will closely approximate the ideal server update.\nTo further enhance stability, we introduce a normalization\nterm to ensure that the fine-tuned LoRA module remains\nclose to its original averaged value, thereby preserving the\naverage information collected from each client. Through\nthis simple yet effective design, LoRA-FAIR provides an\napproach that approximates an ideal solution to both chal-\nlenges by preserving the shared average information in the\ninitial model while striving for accurate aggregation on the\nserver side. Consequently, LoRA-FAIR maximizes the ef-\n\nficacy of LoRA fine-tuning within an FL framework, bal-\nancing performance improvements with computational effi-\nciency. Our key contributions are summarized as follows:\n• We investigate the problem of fine-tuning with LoRA in\nfederated learning setting. Through an initial set of mo-\ntivation experiments, we identify two key challenges that\ncurrently limit the application of LoRA in FL.\n\n• In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel\nmethod named LoRA-FAIR. LoRA-FAIR is the first in\nthe federated fine-tuning domain to simultaneously con-\nsider both the two challenges while maintaining compu-\ntational and communication efficiency.\n\n• We conduct experiments using two pre-trained founda-\ntion models, ViT [11] and MLP-Mixer [37], across vari-\nous large-scale datasets. Our proposed LoRA-FAIR con-\nsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n\n2. Preliminaries\n\n2.1.

Dhillon', 'Cho-Jui Hsieh', 'Sanjiv Kumar'], 'published': '2024-10-27T22:57:12Z', 'summary': 'Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLM that reduces memory requirements. However, current LoRA optimizers lack transformation invariance, meaning the actual updates to the weights depends on how the two LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. This deficiency leads to inefficient learning and sub-optimal solutions in practice. This paper introduces LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method for LoRA optimization, which can achieve transformation invariance and remain computationally efficient.

By freezing the pretrained weights and injecting trainable\nlow-rank matrices into each layer, LoRA significantly reduces memory requirements and mitigates\noverfitting in limited data settings. More formally, letting W ∈ Rm×n be a weight matrix in an\nLLM, LoRA freezes W and introduces a low-rank matrix Z added to W , where Z is represented\nby the multiplication of two rank-r matrices A and B, i.e.,\n\nZ = AB⊤ ∈ Rm×n, A ∈ Rm×r, B ∈ Rn×r, r ≪ min(m, n).\n\n(1)\n\nThe matrices A and B will be referred to as LoRA factors in this paper. Recent research has\nexplored numerous variations and improvements over the classic LoRA algorithm (Valipour et al.,\n2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2024; Yaras et al., 2024).\n\n1 = A2B⊤\n\nDespite being widely used in practice, we find that applying standard optimizers to LoRA leads to\nupdates that are not “transformation invariant”. By definition of LoRA in (1), the same update Z can\nbe decomposed in multiple ways, i.e., Z = A1B⊤\n2 . Ideally, an optimizer should yield the\nsame update to Z regardless of the specific factorization. However, commonly used optimizers with\ndiagonal preconditioners like Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014), Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011), RMSProp\n(Tieleman & Hinton, 2012), and even second-order methods like Shampoo (Gupta et al., 2018)\nand CASPR (Duvvuri et al., 2024), violate this principle when applied to LoRA. This violation\nnot only presents a mathematical inconsistency but also leads to significant inefficiencies during\ntraining. In practice, we observe that one LoRA factor often dominates the optimization process,\nreceiving substantial updates while the other remains nearly fixed. Although this can be partially\nmitigated by some recently proposed approaches such as employing different learning rates for the\ntwo factors (Hayou et al., 2024), we ask the question: is there a more principled way to design an\noptimizer that inherently enforces transformation invariance for LoRA?\n\nTo address this challenge, we first prove that any form of diagonal preconditioner cannot achieve\ntransformation invariance, which motivates the use of matrix preconditioners. However, existing\n\n∗Work done while at Google. 1UCLA 2Google 3UT Austin\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nmatrix preconditioners like Shampoo and CASPR lack transformation invariance and introduce sig-\nnificant computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose LoRA-\nRITE (Robust Invariant Transformation Equilibration), a novel optimizer designed specifically for\nLoRA optimization. LoRA-RITE employs a transformation-invariant preconditioner on the low-\nrank side, achieving transformation invariance without incurring substantial overhead.

Introduced by [1], LoRA significantly\nreduces the computational and memory requirements of finetuning by freezing the pre-\ntrained model weights and inserting low-rank matrices into the model. This approach has\nenabled the adaptation of production-scale models on limited hardware resources while\nachieving performance comparable to full finetuning.\n\nLoRA improvements. Several works have considered improving LoRA performance by\ne.g. using different learning rates for LoRA modules [2], using normalized updates [3],\nsetting adaptive LoRA rank [4, 5], improving initialization [6], and many other variants,\ne.g. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\n\nA critical aspect of LoRA is module selection - deciding which specific components of the\nmodel should receive the low-rank adaptation. In practice, instead of selecting individual\nmodules, one selects module types such as “q_proj” (Query modules), “v_proj” (Value\nmodules), etc. In [1], the authors suggested that inserting LoRA in attention modules\n(Query, Key, and Value) generally yields the best performance among other possible\nplacements. However, in a recent note [13], the same authors further explained the\ndifficulty encountered in LoRA adapter placement, and mentioned that optimal placement\ndepends on pretrained model and the finetuning task. Another work [14] found that for\nsome models, placing LoRA adapters in MLP modules gives better performance. Faced\nwith this confusion, practitioners generally follow one of these guidelines or insert LoRA\nadapters in all modules which comes at a higher finetuning cost. Therefore, it is natural to\nask:\n\nGiven a model and a task, how can we select target module types for LoRA at a reasonable cost?\n\nMemory footprint of LoRA.\nIn practice, LoRA is used to finetune large models with\nrelatively low cost. Consider Llama3.2-3B [15], processing sequences of 2048 tokens with\na batch size of 8. With full finetuning, the memory requirements are substantial. The\nmodel parameters require 12GB in float32, while the Adam optimizer states add another\n24GB. The activations for a single forward pass consume approximately 48GB of memory.\nThis brings the total memory requirement to approximately 84GB necessitating high-end\nGPUs. This becomes more problematic with larger, production-scale models. With LoRA,\nthe computational cost changes dramatically. Using rank-16 adapters on query and value\nmodules introduces only 10 million trainable parameters (0.33% of the model). Notably,\nsince gradients are only computed for the adapter weights, the memory overhead for\ngradient computation is reduced by over 99%. This enables finetuning on a single 24GB\nGPU with the same batch size and sequence length. These low memory footprint is what\nmakes LoRA attractive for finetuning.\n\nAnatomy of a practical module selection method for LoRA finetuning. Based on the\ncomputational constraints outlined above, any practical module selection method for LoRA\nadapter placement must operate within these resource limitations. We identify three main\npillars of a practical method: (i) the method cannot require computing gradients with\nrespect to the full model parameters, as this would defeat the primary purpose of using\nLoRA, (ii) the selection process should not necessitate multiple forward passes through\ndifferent model con'}], 'tool_call_id': 'call_ND4vINgPTSImoINlqEsdOKC9', 'metadata': None, 'timestamp': '2025-12-18T12:11:42.441974+00:00', 'part_kind': 'tool-return'}], 'instructions': 'You are a helpful assistant that answers user questions only based on arxiv research articles.\n\n        When a user asks a query, you always summarize the query using the generate_summary tool.\n        Then you search the index to find relevant results. \n        If you cannot find anything relevant, then you fetch the relevant articles from arxiv using the get_data_to_index tool.\n        Then you perfrom a search using the search tool again.\n\n        You always call the search_quality_check tool after searching the index to evaluate the quality of the retrieved search results.\n        If the search_quality_check tool indicates ""More data is needed"", then you may perform additional search using the suggested_search_terms.\n\n        You provide a complete and correct answer to the user\'s question by summarizing all these search results.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision.

Here are three notable contributions:\n\n1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This paper introduces a novel method that integrates LoRA with federated learning (FL) to address the challenges of Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961v3)\n\n2. **LoRA Done RITE**: This work addresses the lack of transformation invariance in current LoRA optimizers, which leads to inefficient learning. The authors propose LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method that ensures invariant weight updates regardless of how LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. Extensive experiments show that this approach yields consistent accuracy gains across various large language model tasks. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20625v2)\n\n3. **PLoP**: This paper presents PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), which focuses on the adapter placement strategy when using LoRA. By automating the identification of optimal module types for placing LoRA adapters, PLoP enhances the finetuning process for large models. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional placement strategies through comprehensive testing across various tasks.

In this\nsection, we briefly introduce some key work to provide the context\nof our work.\n\n2.1 Sequential Recommendation\nFor the problem of sequential recommendation, the scope was\ninitially confined to the time-based sessions. Recurrent Neural Net-\nwork (RNN) and its variants, including Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) [18] and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) [6], have become a\ncommon choice for session-based recommendations [16, 46]. Other\nmethods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [40],\nMemory Network [5] and Attention Models [22] have also been\nexplored. The hierarchical structure generalized from RNN, Atten-\ntion or CNN based models [7, 31, 45] is used to model transitions\ninter- and intra-sessions. The recent work [45] by You et al. showed\nthat using Temporal Convolutional Network to encode and decode\nsession-level information and GRU for user-level transition is the\nmost effective hierarchical structure. Nevertheless, as many studies\nborrow sequence models from natural language modeling task di-\nrectly, their model performance is usually limited by the relatively\nsmall size and sparse pattern of user behaviors, compared to the\nnature language datasets.\n\nThe attention mechanism was first coined by Bahdanau et al. [2].\nThe original structure is constructed on the hidden states generated\nfrom RNN in order to better capture the long-term dependence\nand align the output for decoder in RNN. The Transformer model\n[42] and several follow-up work [8, 10, 32] showed that for many\nNLP tasks, the sequence-to-sequence network structure based on\nattention alone, a.k.a. self-attention mechanism, is able to outper-\nform existing RNN structures in both accuracy and computation\ncomplexity in long sequences. Motivated by this unique advan-\ntage of self-attention, several studies introduced this mechanism to\nsequential recommendation. SASRec [19], based on self-attention\nmechanism, demonstrated promising results in modeling longer\nuser sequences without the session assumption. Another work\nknown as Multi-temporal rang'}, {'id': '2002.00741v1', 'title': 'Déjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation', 'authors': ['Jibang Wu', 'Renqin Cai', 'Hongning Wang'], 'published': '2020-01-29T20:27:42Z', 'summary': ""Predicting users' preferences based on their sequential behaviors in history is challenging and crucial for modern recommender systems.

This claim is further supported by the initial\nstatistic results obtained from two large datasets later used in our\nevaluation: the mixed Gaussian shape appearing in the time inter-\nval distribution in Figure 2 indicates that a binary interpretation of\ntime gap as in- or cross- session is not accurate enough. Therefore,\nour proposed model adaptively weights the historical influences in\nregard to the user’s drifting impressions from previous interactions\nover time and under its inferred contextual condition.\n\nTraditional RNN-based approaches leave little room for one to\ndynamically adjust the historical influences at current state. One\n\nearlier work, known as Time-LSTM [48], proposed several variants\nof time gate structure to model the variable time intervals as part\nof the recurrent state transition. But this assumes that the temporal\ninfluence only takes effect for once during transition and is fixed\nregardless of context or future events. Thereby, in order to model\nthe influence evolving temporally and contextually, we appeal to\nthe attention based sequence models, which emphasize dependen-\ncies directly on each sequential input rather than relying on the\nrecurrent state transition in RNN models.\n\nIn sequential recommendation, a line of work [19, 38, 39] has\nborrowed the state-of-art self-attention network structure from\nnature language modeling [10, 42]. Tang et al. [39] show that its at-\ntention component can enhance the model capacity in determining\ndependence over an extensively long sequence of history. Never-\ntheless, Kang and McAuley [19] report that the action order in\nlong sequence of user interaction history is lacking in boosting\nthe empirical evaluation performance on several recommendation\ndatasets, even though the position embedding technique is pro-\nposed for self-attention mechanism in its original paper [42].

But this assumes that the temporal\ninfluence only takes effect for once during transition and is fixed\nregardless of context or future events. Thereby, in order to model\nthe influence evolving temporally and contextually, we appeal to\nthe attention based sequence models, which emphasize dependen-\ncies directly on each sequential input rather than relying on the\nrecurrent state transition in RNN models.\n\nIn sequential recommendation, a line of work [19, 38, 39] has\nborrowed the state-of-art self-attention network structure from\nnature language modeling [10, 42]. Tang et al. [39] show that its at-\ntention component can enhance the model capacity in determining\ndependence over an extensively long sequence of history. Never-\ntheless, Kang and McAuley [19] report that the action order in\nlong sequence of user interaction history is lacking in boosting\nthe empirical evaluation performance on several recommendation\ndatasets, even though the position embedding technique is pro-\nposed for self-attention mechanism in its original paper [42]. In\nother words, there is no explicit ordering of input or segment of his-\ntory modeled by self-attention mechanism. Therefore, this presents\nus the opportunity to model temporal and context information as a\nmore informative and flexible order representation to complement\nexisting attention mechanism, bridging the insights from the both\nsides of work in sequential recommendation. But the challenge also\ncomes along as incorporating these information could contribute\nmore noise than signal unless properly structured by the model.\n\nWe propose the Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism\n(CTA), an attention based sequential neural architecture that draws\ndependencies among the historical interactions not only through\nevent correlation but also jointly on temporal and context infor-\nmation for sequential behavior modeling. In this mechanism, we\nweigh the historical influence for each historical action at current\nprediction following the three design questions:\n\n(1) What is the action? The dependency is initially based on the\naction correlation through the self-attention mechanism, i.e.,\nhow such an action is co-related to the current state in the\nsequence.\n\n(2) When did it happen? The influence is also weighed by its tem-\nporal proximity to the predicted action, since the temporal\ndynamics should also play an important role in determining\nthe strength of its connection to presence.\n\n(3) How did it happen? The temporal weighing factor is realized\nas a mixture of the output each from a distinct parameter-\nized kernel function that maps the input of time gaps onto\na specific context of temporal dynamics. And the propor-\ntion of such mixture is determined by the contextual factors,\ninferred from the surrounding actions. In this way, the influ-\nence of a historical action would follow different temporal\ndynamics under different contextual conditions.\n\nWe apply the model on both XING1 and UserBehavior2 dataset\neach with millions of interaction events including user, item and\ntimestamp records. The empirical results on both dataset show\nthat our model improves recommendation performance, compared\n\n1https://github.com/recsyschallenge/2016/blob/master/TrainingDataset.md\n2https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=649\n\n\x0cDéjà vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation\n\nWWW ’20, April 20–24, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan\n\nwith a selection of state-of-the-art approaches.

In this\nsection, we briefly introduce some key work to provide the context\nof our work.\n\n2.1 Sequential Recommendation\nFor the problem of sequential recommendation, the scope was\ninitially confined to the time-based sessions. Recurrent Neural Net-\nwork (RNN) and its variants, including Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) [18] and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) [6], have become a\ncommon choice for session-based recommendations [16, 46]. Other\nmethods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [40],\nMemory Network [5] and Attention Models [22] have also been\nexplored. The hierarchical structure generalized from RNN, Atten-\ntion or CNN based models [7, 31, 45] is used to model transitions\ninter- and intra-sessions. The recent work [45] by You et al. showed\nthat using Temporal Convolutional Network to encode and decode\nsession-level information and GRU for user-level transition is the\nmost effective hierarchical structure.

FourierFormer [17]\ntreats the canonical self-attention as non-parametric regression with methodologies for symmetric\nkernels. [18] considers relative positional embedding with conditional positive definite kernel. [19]\ntreats self-attention operation as support vector regression without considering the asymmetry in the\ndeployed kernel methods, and the supervised regression is not applied in optimzing the attention either.\n[51] addresses the issue of asymmetry, however, it resorts to symmetrization by replacing the softmax\nattention with an approximated symmetric one, thereby still dismissing the asymmetry. These prior\nworks deploy kernel-based techniques that are originally designed for symmetric kernels and request\nto suffice Mercer conditions, which is inconsistent with the asymmetric nature in self-attention,\nresulting in a nontrivial gap between the analytical understanding and numerical implementation\ntowards revealing the rationale in Transformers. In [21], it leverages the kernel tricks from RKBS [22]\nthat allows asymmetry and formulates attention as a binary kernel learning problem via empirical\nrisk minimization. However, it is hard to find an explicit optimization accordingly in implementing\nTransformers. Nevertheless, [21] provides an analytical tool from the aspect of kernel representer\ntheorem upon RKBS that allows asymmetry.\n\nMuch literature has also devoted to improving the efficiency of the attention computation through\ndifferent approximation techniques. In the related works addressing the attention mechanism, Re-\nformer [34] uses locally-sensitive hashing for sparse approximation.

FourierFormer [17]\ntreats the canonical self-attention as non-parametric regression with methodologies for symmetric\nkernels. [18] considers relative positional embedding with conditional positive definite kernel. [19]\ntreats self-attention operation as support vector regression without considering the asymmetry in the\ndeployed kernel methods, and the supervised regression is not applied in optimzing the attention either.\n[51] addresses the issue of asymmetry, however, it resorts to symmetrization by replacing the softmax\nattention with an approximated symmetric one, thereby still dismissing the asymmetry.

K. Suykens'], 'published': '2023-05-31T12:38:24Z', 'summary': 'Recently, a new line of works has emerged to understand and improve self-attention in Transformers by treating it as a kernel machine. However, existing works apply the methods for symmetric kernels to the asymmetric self-attention, resulting in a nontrivial gap between the analytical understanding and numerical implementation. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to represent and optimize self-attention through asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which is also motivated by the low-rank property of self-attention normally observed in deep layers. Through asymmetric KSVD, $i$) a primal-dual representation of self-attention is formulated, where the optimization objective is cast to maximize the projection variances in the attention outputs; $ii$) a novel attention mechanism, i.e., Primal-Attention, is proposed via the primal representation of KSVD, avoiding explicit computation of the kernel matrix in the dual; $iii$) with KKT conditions, we prove that the stationary solution to the KSVD optimization in Primal-Attention yields a zero-value objective. In this manner, KSVD optimization can be implemented by simply minimizing a regularization loss, so that low-rank property is promoted without extra decomposition. Numerical experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our Primal-Attention with improved efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-attention, further verifying the great potential of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization.', 'content': '.\n\nContemporary Mathematics, 26(189-206):2, 1984.\n\n[31] Anthony Bagnall, Hoang Anh Dau, Jason Lines, Michael Flynn, James Large, Aaron Bostrom,\nPaul Southam, and Eamonn Keogh.

The sequence of input items\nis mapped into embedding space with the input item embeddings\nEinput ∈ RN ×din : X = [s1, . . . , sL] · Einput ∈ RL×din . We also trans-\nform the sequence of timestamps into the intervals between each ac-\ntion to current prediction time: T = [tL+1−t1, . . . , tL+1−tL] ∈ RL×1.\nMotivated by our earlier analysis, we design the three stage\nmechanism, namely Mα , M β and Mγ , on top of the processed input\nX and T , to model dependencies among the historical interactions\nrespectively on their content, temporal, and context information:\n\nα = Mα (X ) → β = M β (T ) → γ = Mγ (X , β, α )\n\nIn essence, Mα weighs the influence of each input purely on con-\ntent X and outputs a scalar score as importance of each events in\nsequence α ∈ RL×1; M β transforms the temporal data T through\nK temporal kernels for the temporal weighing of each input β ∈\nRL×K ; Mγ extracts the context information from X , with which it\nmixes the factors α and β from previous stages into the contextu-\nalized temporal importance score γ ∈ RL×1. We will later explain\ntheir individual architectures in details.\n\nIn the end, our model computes the row sum of the input item\nsequence embedding X weighted by γ (through the softmax layer,\nthe weight γ sums up to 1'}], 'tool_call_id': 'call_tDkIRuHlx0QaPn1LGEGDh0PK', 'metadata': None, 'timestamp': '2025-12-18T12:14:18.281810+00:00', 'part_kind': 'tool-return'}, {'tool_name': 'search', 'content': [{'id': '2305.19798v2', 'title': 'Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation', 'authors': ['Yingyi Chen', 'Qinghua Tao', 'Francesco Tonin', 'Johan A.

Here are three notable contributions:\n\n1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This paper introduces a novel method that integrates LoRA with federated learning (FL) to address the challenges of Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961v3)\n\n2. **LoRA Done RITE**: This work addresses the lack of transformation invariance in current LoRA optimizers, which leads to inefficient learning. The authors propose LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method that ensures invariant weight updates regardless of how LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. Extensive experiments show that this approach yields consistent accuracy gains across various large language model tasks. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20625v2)\n\n3. **PLoP**: This paper presents PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), which focuses on the adapter placement strategy when using LoRA. By automating the identification of optimal module types for placing LoRA adapters, PLoP enhances the finetuning process for large models. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional placement strategies through comprehensive testing across various tasks.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing.

The system integrates Yosys synthesis, Icarus Verilog simulation, OpenLane place-and-route, GTKWave analysis, and KLayout visualization into a unified LLM-accessible interface, enabling designers to execute complex multi-tool EDA workflows conversationally via AI assistants such as Claude Desktop and Cursor IDE. The principal contribution is a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology wherein LLMs analyze actual post-layout timing, power, and area metrics from OpenLane results to iteratively refine synthesis TCL scripts, establishing a closed-loop optimization system that bridges the traditional gap between synthesis estimates and physical implementation reality. In contrast to conventional flows that rely on wire-load models, this methodology leverages real backend performance data to guide synthesis parameter tuning, optimization sequence selection, and constraint refinement, with the LLM functioning as an intelligent design space exploration agent. Experimental evaluation on representative digital designs demonstrates 15-30% improvements in timing closure and 10-20% area reduction compared to default synthesis flows, establishing MCP4EDA as the first practical LLM-controlled end-to-end open-source EDA automation system.

Area analysis considers standard\ncell utilization, routing resource consumption, and macro\nplacement efficiency.\n\nThis backend-aware approach optimizes synthesis using\nactual implementation data rather than estimates, resulting\nin improved correlation between synthesis predictions and final\nsilicon performance.\n\nC. Standardized LLM-EDA Integration\n\nMCP4EDA leverages the Model Context Protocol to establish\nstandardized, flexible communication between Large Language\nModels and EDA toolchains. The architecture implements a\nthree-tier structure consisting of MCP Host, MCP Clients, and\n\n\x0cFig. 4: Time vs Area (left) and APU Best Overall Optimization (right)\n\nMCP Server components that collectively enable dynamic tool\norchestration and stateful workflow management.\n\nMCP Clients function as protocol intermediaries, with each\nclient maintaining dedicated connections to specific tool cate-\ngories within the EDA workflow. The multi-client architecture\nprovides: (1) isolation of tool failures preventing cascade errors\nacross the entire workflow, (2) parallel execution capabilities for\nindependent design steps, and (3) modular expansion allowing\nnew tools to be integrated without modifying existing client\nconnections.\n\nEach client maintains state and context throughout optimiza-\ntion cycles. This stateful approach enables the LLM to maintain\nawareness of previous optimization attempts, intermediate\nresults, and design history, facilitating intelligent decision-\nmaking that builds upon previous iterations.\n\nD. Intelligent Tool Selection Framework\n\nThe MCP Server orchestrates intelligent tool execution\nthrough domain-based organization enabling selective, context-\naware tool invocation. The server manages three primary\nfunctional domains: The Simulation domain integrates Icarus\nVerilog for RTL simulation and GTKWave for waveform\nvisualization. The Synthesis domain encompasses TCL script\ngeneration, Yosys synthesis with abc optimization, and backend\nresult analysis capabilities. The Backend domain manages\nOpenLane place-and-route flows, KLayout GDSII visualization,\nand comprehensive design quality assessment tools.\n\nThis domain-based organization enables the LLM to function\nas an intelligent design space exploration agent, selectively\ninvoking relevant toolsets based on current optimization ob-\njectives rather than following predetermined sequences. The\nLLM dynamically selects tools, execution order, and parameters\nbased on design state and objectives.\n\nThe framework tracks optimization history to avoid failed\nconfigurations and identify promising directions, transforming\nrigid EDA workflows into adaptive optimization processes.\n\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nThe experimental evaluation of MCP4EDA’s backend-aware\nsynthesis optimization methodology was conducted using a\ncomprehensive suite of digital designs to assess performance\nimprovements across multiple optimization objectives. The\n\nevaluation employed OpenLane v2.0 as the baseline implemen-\ntation flow, comparing default synthesis configurations against\nMCP4EDA’s LLM-guided optimization strategies.\n\nA. Design Benchmark Suite\n\nThe experimental evaluation utilized a diverse collection\nof RTL designs spanning different complexity levels and\napplication domains to ensure comprehensive assessment of\nthe optimization methodology. The benchmark suite consists of\nnine distinct designs sourced primarily from OpenCores [30],\nrepresenting various digital signal processing, arithmetic, and\ncommunication applications. All designs were synthesized\nusing the SkyWater Sky130 PDK 130nm technology library to\nensure consistency in physical implementation characteristics.\nThree optimization approaches were evaluated to assess\n\nMCP4EDA’s backend-aware synthesis effectiveness:\n\nBaseline Configuration: To establish the effectiveness and\ntargeting effect of different optimization goals, OpenLane’s nine\nexisting synthesis options (DELAY 0-4 and AREA 0-3) were\nexecuted on all benchmark designs. The best results in Delay\nand Area are selected to represent ground-truth performance\nmetrics for comparison.\n\nFixed API Template: Synthesis optimization was performed\nusing fixed API calls with the Claude 4 Sonnet model, utilizing\nexisting physical metrics from the baseline configuration with-\nout further feedback. This configuration represents traditional\ntemplate-based LLM integration approaches that lack iterative\nbackend-aware optimization capabilities.\n\nMCP4EDA Backend-Aware: Physically-aware synthesis op-\ntimization was performed using multiple self-iterations with\nthe Claude 4 Sonnet model, incorporating real backend metrics\nthrough the three-phase optimization workflow described in\nthe methodology section. This configuration represents the\nfull MCP4EDA framework with closed-loop feedback between\nsynthesis decisions and physical implementation results.\n\nAll designs were synthesized using Yosys synthesis tool,\nand the generated netlists we'}], 'tool_call_id': 'call_kQPGyXAR1DXKVYmMbArcgOgO', 'metadata': None, 'timestamp': '2025-12-18T12:15:22.065922+00:00', 'part_kind': 'tool-return'}], 'instructions': 'You are a helpful assistant that answers user questions only based on arxiv research articles.\n\n        When a user asks a query, you always summarize the query using the generate_summary tool.\n        Then you search the index to find relevant results. \n        If you cannot find anything relevant, then you fetch the relevant articles from arxiv using the get_data_to_index tool.\n        Then you perfrom a search using the search tool again.\n\n        You always call the search_quality_check tool after searching the index to evaluate the quality of the retrieved search results.\n        If the search_quality_check tool indicates ""More data is needed"", then you may perform additional search using the suggested_search_terms.\n\n        You provide a complete and correct answer to the user\'s question by summarizing all these search results.
