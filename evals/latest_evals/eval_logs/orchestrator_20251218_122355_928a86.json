Here are three notable contributions:\n\n1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This paper introduces a novel method that integrates LoRA with federated learning (FL) to address the challenges of Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961v3)\n\n2. **LoRA Done RITE**: This work addresses the lack of transformation invariance in current LoRA optimizers, which leads to inefficient learning. The authors propose LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method that ensures invariant weight updates regardless of how LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. Extensive experiments show that this approach yields consistent accuracy gains across various large language model tasks. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20625v2)\n\n3. **PLoP**: This paper presents PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), which focuses on the adapter placement strategy when using LoRA. By automating the identification of optimal module types for placing LoRA adapters, PLoP enhances the finetuning process for large models. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional placement strategies through comprehensive testing across various tasks.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces. This system integrates multiple EDA tools, allowing designers to execute complex workflows conversationally. Key features include a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology that utilizes real performance data from post-layout results to refine synthesis processes, enabling significant improvements in timing closure and area reduction.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision. Recent research has highlighted the following key aspects of FPV and its methods:\n\n1. **FPV Video Analysis**: This approach captures videos from the user's perspective, allowing for better context in tasks such as object detection and activity recognition. It has shifted the focus towards understanding user interactions and behaviors.\n\n2. **Emergence of Wearable Devices**: Smart glasses and action cameras have become vital tools. They include multiple sensing capabilities that can enhance real-time analysis and interaction, offering significant advantages over traditional systems.\n\n3. **Methodological Advances**: Various image features and computational techniques are combined in innovative ways to address challenges unique to FPV, making it a rich area for both research and commercial applications.\n\n4. **Future Directions**: Continuous advances in technology suggest that the field will further develop, with smart wearable devices poised to play a crucial role in the next generation of vision systems.

              "summary": "Astronomy arises very early in a civilization and evolves as the civilization advances. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms. Upon assuming strategically-placed holes in their ceilings we examine the internal movement of sunlight within these rooms and suggest that the larger structure of which they formed a part could have functioned as an astronomical observatory.",
              "content": "the circ-\nular  wall,  the  extremes  of  the  N-S  diameter  of \nthe  room  marked  the  points  where  the  circle  of \nlight  was  cast  at  noon  on  the  solstices.    Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019.

It is therefore reasonable to assume that a vibrant knowledge of astronomy would have been a feature of a civilization the size of the Harappan Civilization. We suggest that structures dedicated to astronomy existed in every major Harappan city. One such city was Dholavira, an important trading port that was located on an island in what is now the Rann of Kutch during the peak of the Harappan Civilization. We have analyzed an unusual structure at Dholavira that includes two circular rooms. Upon assuming strategically-placed holes in their ceilings we examine the internal movement of sunlight within these rooms and suggest that the larger structure of which they formed a part could have functioned as an astronomical observatory.",
              "content": "fication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019. We also wish to gratefully acknowledge \nthe permission given to us by the Archaeological \nSurvey of India to survey Dholavira in 2007, 2008 \nand  2010.   Without  this  it  would  have  been  im-\npossible to carry out our research. We also wish \nto  thank  our  friends  Mr  Kishore  Menon  and \nothers  whose  endless  discussions  greatly  help-\ned  with  this  work.   We  wish  to  thank  Professor \nVasant Shinde for his continuing encouragement; \nProfessor  Sir  Arnold  Wolfendale  for  useful  sug-\ngestions;  and  Nisha  Yadav  for  her  helpful  input \nduring this research. Finally,  we are  particularly \ngrateful to  Professor Wayne Orchiston for  all of \nthe  effort  he  took  to  make  the  contents  of  this \npaper precise and clear. \n\n6  REFERENCES \nAgrawal, D.P., 2007.

              "content": "the circ-\nular  wall,  the  extremes  of  the  N-S  diameter  of \nthe  room  marked  the  points  where  the  circle  of \nlight  was  cast  at  noon  on  the  solstices.    Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019.
