Here are three notable contributions:\n\n1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This paper introduces a novel method that integrates LoRA with federated learning (FL) to address the challenges of Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision.

In this work, we aim to better understand and explore the design space of caretaking activities with 10 children, aged 8--12 from eight families, involving an exploratory design session followed by a preliminary feasibility testing of robot caretaking activities. The design sessions provided insight into children's current caretaking tasks, how they would take care of a social robot, and how these new caretaking activities could be integrated into their daily routines. The feasibility study tested two different types of robot caretaking tasks, which we call connection and utility, and measured their short term effects on children's perceptions of and closeness to the social robot.

We then conducted a brief feasibility\nstudy that tested two types of caretaking tasks and measured how\nchildren perceived the robot and how close they felt to the robot\nafter completing the care tasks.

Limited work shows how\npeople can benefit from expressing care towards non-robot applica-\ntions, such as chatbots. For example, people whom interacted with a\ncare-receiving chatbot by comforting it had increased positive men-\ntal health outcomes in self-compassion [18]. In another study [32], a\nsocial robot deployed in the workspace for 10 work days was found\nmore effective in helping users better manage their breaks. The\nsocial robot responded to \u201cpetting,\u201d displayed agitation for succes-\nsive break alerts, and needed to be \u201cfed\u201d fruits represented by RFID\ncards. Research focused on caretaking in child-robot interactions\nis limited, however some studies reported children spontaneously\ndemonstrating robot care behaviors. For example, a social robot was\ndeployed in an early childhood education center for five months,\nand toddlers showed more caretaking behaviors for the robot (such\nas putting a blanket on the robot while saying \u201cnight-night\u201d) than\nother objects such as an immobile robotic toy, treating the care-\nreceiving robot as a peer [36]. As part of their findings, Tanaka et al.\n[36] reported a set of factors that impacted the quality of children\u2019s\ninteraction with the robot, including caretaking, rough-housing,\nhugging, touching the robot with objects, or touching the robot\u2019s\nhead, face, trunk, arm, hand, leg, or foot. These factors manifested\n\nin children\u2019s behaviors differently depending on the robot, for ex-\nample, violent rough-housing was observed only for the immobile\nrobotic toy, while children frequently hugged the care-receiving ro-\nbot. Tanaka and Kimura [37] explains that such care activities are a\npart of children\u2019s development of learning by teaching. They argued\nthat, the robot being a \u201cweaker\u201d entity than the children, in size\nand sophistication, motivated children\u2019s care interactions with the\nrobot in the classroom. However, research exploring caretaking in\nchild-robot interactions are typically limited to a classroom context\nand the literature lacks insight into how robot caretaking might\nbe formed in children\u2019s homes. While our work is also situated in\na laboratory context, we aim to extract initial design factors for\nchildren\u2019s robot caretaking tasks that would later be transferable\nto the home setting.\n\nLong Term Child-Robot Interactions. The design of social robots\nthat can sustain long-term interactions with children is key for\nexploring how children would take care of a robot in their homes.\nHowever, human-robot interaction (HRI) researchers [9, 10, 41]\nas well as companies that have developed social robots (e.g., Jibo,\nAnki, Kuri) have continued to face barriers to sustaining long-term\nhuman-robot interactions.

In this paper, we explore the activity\nof caretaking of a social robot as a new and unique responsibility\nintroduced by in-home, long-term interactions with a robot. Care-\ntaking might range from maintaining the robot by charging and\ncleaning, protecting it by providing a shelter and a safe space, or\nproviding companionship by chatting, playing games, or reading\ntogether. It also serves as a new and exciting design space with\nthe potential to craft a positive user experience that facilitates the\nforming of lasting bond between the child and the robot.\n\nSimilar to a friendship between two people or the connection\nbetween a person and a real or artificial pet (e.g., the Tamagotchi in\na key-chain form[22]), we aim to explore how meaningful, lasting\ninterpersonal connections might be formed between children and\nrobots by designing a robot capable of also receiving care [37] rather\nthan simply giving care. Prior research has shown that caring for\nan interactive toy, robot, or chatbot by comforting [18], teaching\n[23], or touching [34] it can help form stronger connections and\nfacilitate positive outcomes such as improvements in mental health\nin adults [18], learning gains in children [23], and the amount of\ntime adults spent on a monotonous task [34]. Building on these\nfindings, we posit that the key to developing a social companion\nrobot for families, particularly for children, that overcomes barriers\nto successful long-term human-robot interaction is the formation of\nlasting interpersonal connections between the robot and its users.\nWe explore how designing a robot that is capable of receiving care\nfrom its users might facilitate the forming of such relationships.\nOur work aims to address the following questions:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIDC \u201922, June 27\u201330, 2022, Braga, Portugal\n\nBengisu Cagiltay, Joseph Michaelis, Sarah Sebo, and Bilge Mutlu\n\nFigure 1: Children reading to the robot for a bedtime care routine: In this study we explored children\u2019s preferences for taking\ncare of a social robot and conducted a feasibility study to evaluate children\u2019s experience of taking care of a robot. Our findings\nprovide insight into designing social robot caretaking activities for children.\n\nRQ1. What types of in-home robot caretaking tasks will be\n\nperformed regularly by children?\n\nRQ2. How can we design robot caretaking tasks with children\nto foster interpersonal connections and long-term use of\nthe robot?\n\nAs a first step toward addressing these questions, we conducted\nan exploratory design study that explored what types of caretaking\ntasks children would prefer and how these care obligations would\nfit in their daily routines. We then conducted a brief feasibility\nstudy that tested two types of caretaking tasks and measured how\nchildren perceived the robot and how close they felt to the robot\nafter completing the care tasks. This work makes the following\ncontributions.\n\n(1) A characterization of caretaking as a design space for child-\n\nrobot interaction design;\n\n(2) An understanding of children\u2019s preferences for robot caretak-\n\ning activities;\n\n(3) A preliminary understanding of children\u2019s perceptions of\n\ndesigned caretaking interactions.\n\n2 BACKGROUND\n\nCaretaking in Child-Robot Interactions. Limited work shows how\npeople can benefit from expressing care towards non-robot applica-\ntions, such as chatbots. For example, people whom interacted with a\ncare-receiving chatbot by comforting it had increased positive men-\ntal health outcomes in self-compassion [18]. In another study [32], a\nsocial robot deployed in the workspace for 10 work days was found\nmore effective in helping users better manage their breaks. The\nsocial robot responded to \u201cpetting,\u201d displayed agitation for succes-\nsive break alerts, and needed to be \u201cfed\u201d fruits represented by RFID\ncards. Research focused on caretaking in child-robot interactions\nis limited, however some studies reported children spontaneously\ndemonstrating robot care behaviors. For example, a social robot was\ndeployed in an early childhood education center for five months,\nand toddlers showed more caretaking behaviors for the robot (such\nas putting a blanket on the robot while saying \u201cnight-night\u201d) than\nother objects such as an immobile robotic toy, treating the care-\nreceiving robot as a peer [36].

Self-Adaptive Software\n\nSelf-adaptive software aims to autonomously adjust its vari-\nous attributes in response to the detected context [12]. Context\nrefers to various environmental factors that can potentially\naffect the software. Self-adaptive software requires continuous\nmonitoring and adaptation to the context changes; thus, an\nadaptation cycle is required, and the cycle is called MAPE\nloop. MAPE loop is generally applied in self-adaptive software\nand consists of four processes [12]:\n\n\u2022 Monitoring, which is responsible for collecting data from\n\nthe software and operating environment.\n\n\u2022 Analyzing (detecting), which is responsible for analyzing\nthe symptoms using data from the monitoring process.\n\u2022 Planning (deciding), which is responsible for deciding\nhow to change artifacts or attributes to improve perfor-\nmance.\n\n\u2022 Executing (acting), which is responsible for applying\n\nchanges.\n\nThe concept of self-adaptive software is applied in various\nfields such as healthcare [13], smart farming [14], smart homes\n[15], and smart buildings [16]. In this study, it is assumed that\nhealth conditions of children can be continuously changed\nand require adaptation to respond to these health changes.\nTherefore, the concept of self-adaptive software was applied\nto manage childhood healthcare.\n\nB.

In several studies, IoT sensors including medical de-\nvices (e.g., force, heart rate, pulse oximetry, pressure, glucose,\ntemperature, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and elec-\ntroencephalogram), smartphones (e.g., gyroscope, accelerom-\neter, and microphone), and wearable devices were developed\nand used to collect healthcare-related data via the Internet\n[6], [17].

The pervasive influence of technology on daily lives necessitates a deep understanding of its impact on mental health services. This study synthesizes literature covering Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BITs), digital mental health interventions during COVID-19, young men's attitudes toward mental health technologies, technology-based interventions for university students, and the applicability of mobile health technologies for individuals with serious mental illnesses. BITs are recognized for their potential to provide evidence-based interventions for mental health conditions, especially anxiety disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for the adoption of digital mental health services, underscoring their crucial role in providing accessible and quality care; however, their efficacy needs to be reinforced by workforce training, high-quality evidence, and digital equity. A nuanced understanding of young men's attitudes toward mental health is imperative for devising effective online services. Technology-based interventions for university students are promising, although variable in effectiveness; their deployment must be evidence-based and tailored to individual needs. Mobile health technologies, particularly activity tracking, hold promise for individuals with serious mental illnesses.

The findings of this review indicate \n\nthat technology-based interventions targeting certain mental health and related problems offer \n\npromise for students in university settings. However, more high-quality trials that fully report \n\nrandomization methods, outcome data, and data analysis methods are needed (Farrer et al., \n\n2013). The use of technology, particularly internet-based interventions, in addressing mental \n\nhealth issues among university students is promising.

The pervasive influence of technology on daily lives necessitates a deep understanding of its impact on mental health services. This study synthesizes literature covering Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BITs), digital mental health interventions during COVID-19, young men's attitudes toward mental health technologies, technology-based interventions for university students, and the applicability of mobile health technologies for individuals with serious mental illnesses. BITs are recognized for their potential to provide evidence-based interventions for mental health conditions, especially anxiety disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for the adoption of digital mental health services, underscoring their crucial role in providing accessible and quality care; however, their efficacy needs to be reinforced by workforce training, high-quality evidence, and digital equity. A nuanced understanding of young men's attitudes toward mental health is imperative for devising effective online services. Technology-based interventions for university students are promising, although variable in effectiveness; their deployment must be evidence-based and tailored to individual needs. Mobile health technologies, particularly activity tracking, hold promise for individuals with serious mental illnesses. Collectively, technology has immense potential to revolutionize mental health care.

Elsevier, 2015.\n\n\f\u00002\n\nBackground \n\nHuman-Robot Interaction\n\nGoodrich and Schultz (2007) describe the HRI problem as seeking \u201cto \nunderstand and shape the interactions between one or more humans and one \nor more robots.\u201d They decompose the problem into \ufb01ve principle attributes: \n(i) the level and behavior of a robot\u2019s autonomy, (ii) the nature of information \nexchange between human and robot, (iii) the structure of the human-robot \nteam, (iv) how people and robots adapt and learn from one another, and (v) \nhow the task shapes interaction. \n\nAll of these factors play a role in how a mental healthcare professional might \nconsider the use of robotics technology in their practice. However, there are \ntwo additional factors that may be of particular importance to practitioners. \nThe \ufb01rst is the morphology, or form, of the robot itself. Robots can range in \nappearance from very mechanical-looking to very anthropomorphic in \nappearance (Riek, Rabinowitch, Chakrabarti, & Robinson, 2009). \nMorphology is a richly debated topic in the research community, with many \nstudies showing people will anthropomorphize and form attachments to \nnearly anything conveying animacy. Some researchers worry this not only \nconveys inaccurate expectations to people about a robot\u2019s capabilities, but \nmay also be unethical when treating vulnerable populations (Riek, Hartzog, \nHoward, Moon, & Calo, 2015; Riek & Howard, 2014). For example, \nindividuals with cognitive impairments or children may be more susceptible \nto deception and manipulation by robots. \n\nA second factor that can impact the HRI problem is individual differences \nbetween people. People have a wide range of existing cognitive and physical \nattributes which can greatly in\ufb02uence how they perceive, interact with, and \naccept robots (Hayes & Riek, 2014). These factors may be particularly \nimportant when considering the use of robotics technology for clients in \nmental healthcare settings, who may have further unique needs. \n\n\u00a9 2016 Laurel Riek.

These robots have \nbeen used for helping treat people with dementia, autism, and cognitive impairments; have \nhelped provide companionship for people who were lonely; have been used to help educate \nchildren with developmental disabilities; and have been used to help improve how people with \nvisible disabilities are treated.

The \nrobots in this \ufb01gure are representative of the state-of the-art for socially \ninteractive robots. Robots with more mechanistic appearances have been used \nin other applications, though very few in mental health care. \n\nWhile zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and cartoon-like morphologies are the \nmost common, some robot designers have explored other unique \nrepresentations.

Understanding the factors influencing obesity is very complex since there are many variables that can affect the health behaviors leading to it. Nowadays, multiple data sources can be used to study health behaviors, such as wearable sensors for physical activity and sleep, social media, mobile and health data. In this paper we describe the design of a dashboard for the visualization of actigraphy and biometric data from a childhood obesity camp in Qatar. This dashboard allows quantitative discoveries that can be used to guide patient behavior and orient qualitative research.",

Other ones [5]\nfocus on the representation of the data rather than its explo-\nration and companionship across the groups. Our next steps\n\ninclude performing qualitative evaluation of our dashboard\nand improvements based on the end users\u2019 feedback.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe would like to acknowledge the contributions of Dr.\nthe\nMohamed Ahmedna from Qatar University, and all\nmembers of the ICAN project, along with our colleagues\nat QCRI.
