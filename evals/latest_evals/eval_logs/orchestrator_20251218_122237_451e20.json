Here are three notable contributions:\n\n1. **LoRA-FAIR**: This paper introduces a novel method that integrates LoRA with federated learning (FL) to address the challenges of Server-Side Aggregation Bias and Client-Side Initialization Lag. By refining the aggregation process and ensuring consistent initialization across rounds, LoRA-FAIR significantly improves performance in FL settings, demonstrating effective fine-tuning on models like ViT and MLP-Mixer while maintaining computational efficiency. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961v3)\n\n2. **LoRA Done RITE**: This work addresses the lack of transformation invariance in current LoRA optimizers, which leads to inefficient learning. The authors propose LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method that ensures invariant weight updates regardless of how LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. Extensive experiments show that this approach yields consistent accuracy gains across various large language model tasks. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20625v2)\n\n3. **PLoP**: This paper presents PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), which focuses on the adapter placement strategy when using LoRA. By automating the identification of optimal module types for placing LoRA adapters, PLoP enhances the finetuning process for large models. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional placement strategies through comprehensive testing across various tasks.

Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces. This system integrates multiple EDA tools, allowing designers to execute complex workflows conversationally. Key features include a backend-aware synthesis optimization methodology that utilizes real performance data from post-layout results to refine synthesis processes, enabling significant improvements in timing closure and area reduction. The structured framework consists of an MCP Server and Clients that facilitate dynamic tool orchestration and stateful workflow management, making it adaptable to design needs. \n\n## References\n- [MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol RTL-to-GDSII Automation with Backend Aware Synthesis Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19570v1)\n when is sub-game perfect equilibria also a nash equilibria in an infinite game? # Sub-game Perfect Equilibria and Nash Equilibria in Infinite Games\n\n## Summary \n In infinite games, sub-game perfect equilibria can also be Nash equilibria under certain conditions related to time-inconsistency and player preferences. Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision. Recent research has highlighted the following key aspects of FPV and its methods:\n\n1. **FPV Video Analysis**: This approach captures videos from the user's perspective, allowing for better context in tasks such as object detection and activity recognition. It has shifted the focus towards understanding user interactions and behaviors.\n\n2. **Emergence of Wearable Devices**: Smart glasses and action cameras have become vital tools. They include multiple sensing capabilities that can enhance real-time analysis and interaction, offering significant advantages over traditional systems.\n\n3. **Methodological Advances**: Various image features and computational techniques are combined in innovative ways to address challenges unique to FPV, making it a rich area for both research and commercial applications.\n\n4. **Future Directions**: Continuous advances in technology suggest that the field will further develop, with smart wearable devices poised to play a crucial role in the next generation of vision systems. Current and future research includes tackling challenges related to processing efficiency and user engagement. \n\n## References\n- [The Evolution of First Person Vision Methods: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1484v3)\n\n            Current query: literature review on histories of childhoods and media in colonial era\n        ",

A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms.

The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective. Instead, we learn from a seed of political keywords and use Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning to detect political comments in reaction to non-political news articles posted on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. Our findings indicate that all platforms show evidence of politicization as discussion around topics adjacent to politics such as economy, crime and drugs tend to shift to politics.

              "summary": "Politicization is a social phenomenon studied by political science characterized by the extent to which ideas and facts are given a political tone. A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms. In this work, we propose a computational method for assessing politicization in online conversations based on topic shifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in online conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective. Instead, we learn from a seed of political keywords and use Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning to detect political comments in reaction to non-political news articles posted on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. Our findings indicate that all platforms show evidence of politicization as discussion around topics adjacent to politics such as economy, crime and drugs tend to shift to politics. Even the least politicized topics had the rate in which their topics shift to politics increased in the lead up to the elections and after other political events in Brazil -- an evidence of politicization.",
              "content": "ted, paraphrased, and\nmodified (while keeping the general meaning).\n\nFigure 6: Average number of comments between topic shifts\ntoward politics for all YouTube videos by month. A smaller\nnumber means that users shift more frequently toward poli-\ntics. In the start of 2022 there were few videos of the most\npoliticized topics, hence the larger confidence interval (gray\narea). Again, an increase in topic shifts toward politics coin-\ncides with the election period.\n\nOur work focuses on assessing and characterizing politi-\ncization without using any manual labels, which can acceler-\nate and encourage further research in the political sciences.\nWhile we acknowledge that the accuracy of the classifier in\nthe range of 84% is a potential threat to the validity of the re-\nsults, since a correct topic shift is a result of a correct classi-\nfication of both the news posts and the comment, we believe\nthe effect of the prediction error is minimized due to two\nefforts: (1) we manually discarded the misclassified topical\nclusters of news posts, and (2) since each post receives on\naverage tenths or hundreds of comments (Table 1), the errors\ntend to cancel out and a signal of politicization still emerges,\nas the analysis in Tables 8 and 9, and Figure 6 made clear.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Igor Joaquim da Silva Costa,\nMateus F.

We use textual representation and semantic embeddings of narratives to represent the interviews themselves. Our analysis demonstrates that shared origin is a powerful determinant of narrative similarity across thematic keywords, landmarks, and significant figures, as well as in semantic embeddings of the narratives.

Grounded in Halbwachs' theory of group memory, we employ statistical analysis of pairwise similarity of narratives, focusing on the influence of shared gender and location. We use textual representation and semantic embeddings of narratives to represent the interviews themselves. Our analysis demonstrates that shared origin is a powerful determinant of narrative similarity across thematic keywords, landmarks, and significant figures, as well as in semantic embeddings of the narratives. Meanwhile, shared residence fosters cohesion, with its impact significantly amplified when paired with shared origin. Additionally, women's narratives exhibit heightened thematic cohesion, particularly in recounting experiences of the British occupation, underscoring the gendered dimensions of memory formation. This research deepens the understanding of collective memory in diasporic settings, emphasizing the critical role of oral histories in safeguarding Palestinian identity and resisting erasure.",

As Toiva-\nnen and Baser (2019) state, diasporic memory is\nnot constrained by spatial boundaries, therefore\nrefugees can participate in group recollection with\nothers from the same origins even when they are\nphysically separate.

However, we highlight sig-\nnificant differences. Namely, increased cohesion\nconcerning themes in general (keywords) and pre-\nNakba village context. This connects to two factors\nthat influence group memory. First, the constructed\nsocial and cultural roles of gender among Pales-\ntinians in refugee camps, and second, the nature\nof refugee camps as spaces of displacement and\nvulnerability, which operate under unique socio-\neconomic constraints that profoundly shape gen-\nder dynamics. Second, pre-Nakba, villages were\nclosely knit communities where women\u2019s roles and\nresponsibilities were shaped by communal prac-\ntices and survival strategies, including support-\ning resistance (Sayigh, 2007; Tamari, 2008; Nimr,\n2008; Yahya, 2017). In these settings, women often\ninternalized dominant national narratives shaped\nby the era, which laid the foundation for their role\nin the broader narrative of resistance (Tamari, 2008;\nSayigh, 1998; Yahya, 2017).\n\nWomen\u2019s factual cohesion appears strongest\nwhen referencing specific landmarks or entities in\ntranscripts. This can be associated with their emo-\ntional connection to physical places. In contrast,\nmen\u2019s narratives exhibit notable divergence in their\ndescriptions of landmarks, families, and other en-\ntities.

Grounded in Halbwachs' theory of group memory, we employ statistical analysis of pairwise similarity of narratives, focusing on the influence of shared gender and location. We use textual representation and semantic embeddings of narratives to represent the interviews themselves. Our analysis demonstrates that shared origin is a powerful determinant of narrative similarity across thematic keywords, landmarks, and significant figures, as well as in semantic embeddings of the narratives. Meanwhile, shared residence fosters cohesion, with its impact significantly amplified when paired with shared origin. Additionally, women's narratives exhibit heightened thematic cohesion, particularly in recounting experiences of the British occupation, underscoring the gendered dimensions of memory formation. This research deepens the understanding of collective memory in diasporic settings, emphasizing the critical role of oral histories in safeguarding Palestinian identity and resisting erasure.",

Second, pre-Nakba, villages were\nclosely knit communities where women\u2019s roles and\nresponsibilities were shaped by communal prac-\ntices and survival strategies, including support-\ning resistance (Sayigh, 2007; Tamari, 2008; Nimr,\n2008; Yahya, 2017). In these settings, women often\ninternalized dominant national narratives shaped\nby the era, which laid the foundation for their role\nin the broader narrative of resistance (Tamari, 2008;\nSayigh, 1998; Yahya, 2017).\n\nWomen\u2019s factual cohesion appears strongest\nwhen referencing specific landmarks or entities in\ntranscripts.
