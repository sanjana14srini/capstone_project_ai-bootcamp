This study explores the impact of various context-based approaches to object detection. Initially, we investigate the role of context in object detection and survey it from several perspectives. We then review and discuss the most recent context-based object detection approaches and compare them. Finally, we conclude by addressing research questions and identifying gaps for further studies. More than 265 publications are included in this survey, covering different aspects of context in different categories of object detection, including general object detection, video object detection, small object detection, camouflaged object detection, zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot object detection. This literature review presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in context-based object detection, providing valuable contributions such as a thorough understanding of contextual information and effective methods for integrating various context types into object detection, thus benefiting researchers.",

For example, in surveillance systems, sound context can be used to detect gunshots \nor breaking glass, which can indicate potential security threats. In autonomous driving sys-\ntems, sound context can be used to detect and recognize different types of vehicles or to \ndetect and avoid obstacles that are not visible in the visual data. The integration of audio \ncontext  into  multimodal  models,  using  techniques  such  as  multimodal  fusion  (Gao  et  al. \n2020) and attention mechanisms (Lieskovsk\u00e1 et al. 2021) enables a comprehensive compre-\nhension of the scene by capturing the relationships between visual and audio data. Figure 25 \nprovides an example of leveraging audio context to detect objects alongside visual feature \nmaps.\n\nIn addition to the presence of objects, audio also determines distances and even direc-\ntions. For example, by hearing the sound of a bird, in addition to identifying the bird as an \nobject, the approximate distance and direction of the sound can also be identified.

In a scene understanding system, text context can be used to identify \nspecific  objects  within  the  scene  or  to  infer  relationships  between  objects  based  on  their \nlabels or descriptions. To incorporate text context into computer vision algorithms, natu-\nral language processing (NLP) techniques are effective approaches to analyze and extract \ntextual information from various sources, such as image captions, object labels, or product \ndescriptions. Machine learning algorithms can then be trained on this data to recognize pat-\nterns and identify specific objects or scenes based on their textual context.\n\n2.4.13  Illumination context\n\nIllumination  context  refers  to  the  study  of  how  lighting  conditions  affect  the  appearance \nof  objects  in  a  scene  and  how  this  information  can  be  used  to  improve  computer  vision \nalgorithms. Illumination context involves information such as sun direction (Lalonde et al. \n2008), sky color, shadow contrast, and covered by clouds. Illumination context is important \nbecause the way light interacts with objects in a scene can dramatically affect their appear-\nance.  By  analyzing  the  illumination  context  of  a  scene,  computer  vision  algorithms  can \nadjust for variations in lighting conditions and make more accurate predictions about the \nappearance and behavior of objects in that scene.\n\n2.4.14  Weather context\n\nIn outdoor applications, there is no escape from \u201cbad\u201d weather.

In a scene understanding system, text context can be used to identify \nspecific  objects  within  the  scene  or  to  infer  relationships  between  objects  based  on  their \nlabels or descriptions. To incorporate text context into computer vision algorithms, natu-\nral language processing (NLP) techniques are effective approaches to analyze and extract \ntextual information from various sources, such as image captions, object labels, or product \ndescriptions. Machine learning algorithms can then be trained on this data to recognize pat-\nterns and identify specific objects or scenes based on their textual context.\n\n2.4.13  Illumination context\n\nIllumination  context  refers  to  the  study  of  how  lighting  conditions  affect  the  appearance \nof  objects  in  a  scene  and  how  this  information  can  be  used  to  improve  computer  vision \nalgorithms. Illumination context involves information such as sun direction (Lalonde et al. \n2008), sky color, shadow contrast, and covered by clouds. Illumination context is important \nbecause the way light interacts with objects in a scene can dramatically affect their appear-\nance.  By  analyzing  the  illumination  context  of  a  scene,  computer  vision  algorithms  can \nadjust for variations in lighting conditions and make more accurate predictions about the \nappearance and behavior of objects in that scene.\n\n2.4.14  Weather context\n\nIn outdoor applications, there is no escape from \u201cbad\u201d weather.

For example, a person is next to a skateboard based on spatial context, and a \nhelmet and skateboard commonly appear together based on semantic context.\n\nM. Jamali et al.1 3 \n \n\fFig. 32  Visual relation detection and \nits scene graph representation\n\nPage 29 of 89 \n\n  175 \n\nFig. 33  Integrating spatial and semantic context into a graph-based model (Zhang et al. 2021)\n\nFigure 33 demonstrates how context can be integrated into a graph-based object detec-\ntion  framework.  The  object  detector  first  identifies  bounding  boxes  for  detected  objects. \nThen,  Visual  Region  Network  builds  a  graph  with  objects  as  nodes  and  relationships  as \nedges,  capturing  spatial  connections  like  \u2019above\u2019  or  \u2019next  to\u2019.  Spatial  Network  encodes \nspatial relationships, enhancing the model\u2019s understanding of object positioning. Semantic \nNetwork processes category relationships, identifying associations like \u2019person rides horse\u2019. \nBy combining these contextual layers, the model refines object detections, as seen in rela-\ntionships like \u2019horse above grass\u2019.\n\nIn this section, we explore five graph-based approaches, each leveraging context differ-\n\nently to enhance object detection.\n\n(1)  Distilling Knowledge Graph (Yang et al. 2023) seamlessly integrates spatial and seman-\ntic context into object detection using a knowledge graph and knowledge distillation \n(KD). By leveraging a teacher-student model, the method constructs both geometry and \nsemantic graphs through a transformer layer, capturing object interactions at both local \nand global levels. The edges in the graph encode relationships, which are incorporated \ninto the attention matrix to enable graph-level attention, enhancing contextual learning. \nAmong  graph-based  approaches  in  this  paper  tested  on  COCO  dataset,  this  method \nachieves the highest AP, APs, APm, and APl.\n\n(2)  Knowledge-guided Reasonable Object Detection (KROD) (Ji et al. 2022) focuses on \nglobal  context  and  category  relationships.  It  introduces  Global  Category  Knowledge \nMining (GKM) that integrates multi-label image-level classification results to provide \nglobal  category  knowledge  for  the  detector. Additionally,  the  raw  detection  outputs \n\nContext in object detection: a systematic literature review1 3 \n \n\f  175 \n\n  Page 30 of 89\n\nwere  inputted  by  the  Category  Relationship Knowledge  Mining  (CRM)  module  into \nthe object category co-occurrence-based knowledge graph to further refine the initial \nresults.\n\n(3)  The Structure Inference Network (SIN) (Liu et al. 2018) enhances object detection by \nintegrating both scene-level and instance-level contextual information within a graphi-\ncal model framework. In SIN, objects are represented as nodes in a graph, and their \nrelationships  form  the  edges,  allowing  the  model  to  capture  object  interactions  and \nscene context. Incorporated into a standard detection framework like Faster R-CNN, \nSIN  utilizes  this  structured  context  to  iteratively  update  each  object\u2019s  state,  refining \npredictions based on both local appearance and surrounding context, thus improving \naccuracy in complex scenes.\n\n(4)  Adaptive context-aware object detection (AdaCon) (Neseem and Reda 2021) uses the \nspatial co-occurrence probabilities of object categories to create an adaptive network. A \nbranch controller selects which sections of the network to execute during runtime based \non the spatial context of the input frame. AdaCon is the first detector to present an adap-\ntive algorithm for one-stage object detectors.\n\n(5)  JLWSOD (Lai et al. 2024) a method for weakly supervised object detection, integrates \ntwo types of contextual information: instance-wise correlation and semantic-wise cor-\nrelation.  The  framework  comprises  three  key  modules:  the  Instance-Wise  Detection \nBranch, which enhances object localization by capturing correlations among spatially \nadjacent  instances;  the  Semantic-Wise  Prediction  Branch,  which  addresses  semantic \nambiguity by modeling relationships between co-occurring object categories; and the \nInteractive Graph Contrastive Learning (iGCL) module, which facilitates the joint opti-\nmization  of  both  contextual  information  types.  This  interactive  learning  mechanism \nallows  for  effective  propagation  of  image-level  supervisory  signals  to  instance-level \npredictions.\n\nEach  of  the  reviewed  models  demonstrates  distinct  approaches  to  incorporating  context \nin  object  detection,  revealing  both  strengths  and  limitations  in  various  technical  aspects. \nThe Distilling Knowledge Graph approach is computationally efficient, benefiting from a \nknowledge graph that integrates spatial and semantic context, but relies heavily on a teacher-\nstudent framework, which can complicate training set"
