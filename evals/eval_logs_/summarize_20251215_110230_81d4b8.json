Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.",

One approach involves systematic derivation of defense mechanisms from the functional requirements of CPSs, especially in critical infrastructure applications like water treatment, which is conceptually similar to greenhouse systems. This includes generating invariants that define the expected behaviors of the system. The research emphasizes the need for robust models that can predict behaviors and detect anomalies, thereby ensuring the integrity and efficiency of greenhouse operations. Another perspective is employing physics-based modeling to detect attacks on these systems, ensuring that environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and light are kept within optimal ranges for plant growth. The findings suggest that combining axiomatic design principles with data analytics could yield better predictive capabilities in greenhouse system management.\",\"references\":[{\"title\":\"Towards Systematically Deriving Defence Mechanisms from Functional Requirements of Cyber-Physical Systems\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03651v2\"},{\"title\":\"Modeling cyber and physical interdependencies - Application in ICT and power grids\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03651v2\"},{\"title\":\"A Survey of Physics-Based Attack Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03651v2\"}]}",

    "title": "Modeling Cyber-Physical Systems for Greenhouse Environment",
    "summary": "Research has highlighted various methodologies for modeling physical systems within greenhouse environments, primarily focusing on cyber-physical systems (CPS). One approach involves systematic derivation of defense mechanisms from the functional requirements of CPSs, especially in critical infrastructure applications like water treatment, which is conceptually similar to greenhouse systems. This includes generating invariants that define the expected behaviors of the system. The research emphasizes the need for robust models that can predict behaviors and detect anomalies, thereby ensuring the integrity and efficiency of greenhouse operations. Another perspective is employing physics-based modeling to detect attacks on these systems, ensuring that environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and light are kept within optimal ranges for plant growth. The findings suggest that combining axiomatic design principles with data analytics could yield better predictive capabilities in greenhouse system management.",
