[26] found that while parents and adolescents tend to agree that adolescents have\nsome right to privacy, both parties believe that parents are justi\ufb01ed in overriding that right to pri-\nvacy in emergency situations. In a similar vein, Czeskis et al. [27] found that adolescents are more\nwilling to share information (e.g., location) with their parents in emergency situations compared to\nnon-emergency situations. Neither of these studies focused on health-related information, which\ncan be particularly sensitive. Hong et al. [43] highlighted the need to develop data sharing models\nthat balance adolescent patients\u2019 autonomy and safety, cautioning against the use of a strict open\nor closed data access policy. We found that although participants resisted close monitoring around\ntheir everyday activities, they understood the importance of keeping their parents informed in the\nevent of emergencies. Building on prior work, our results suggest that health tracking technologies\ncan support a data sharing model based on emergency versus non-emergency situations.\nThat is, tracking technologies can support adolescents in maintaining privacy and control over\nroutine health information while providing mechanisms to release information in emergency con-\ntexts. For example, wearable devices can support the collection of routine health information and\nalso serve as detection systems (e.g., for asthma [101]). In such a scenario, an adolescent\u2019s tracked\ndata would not be visible to their parents without prior consent, but a sign of an asthma attack\nwould immediately permit their parents to see vital signs.\n\n5.2 Preparing Adolescents to Transition\nIn this section, we discuss technological avenues to support adolescents\u2019 independent health man-\nagement skills and prepare them to handle the responsibilities of adult healthcare.\n\n5.2.1 Building Self-E\ufb00icacy.

Engaging in collaborative re\ufb02ection can enable adolescents to develop a deeper under-\nstanding of their medical history and be more prepared to answer providers\u2019 questions about their\nhealth. One participant even took a physical diary containing shared notes to appointments when\nher mother could not attend, suggesting that shared data can provide adolescents with the knowl-\nedge and con\ufb01dence they need to meet with providers alone. We see possibilities for the design of\napplications that align with participants\u2019 existing practices of writing in shared diaries and posting\nsticky notes in shared spaces. For example, adolescents and parents could use their own mobile\ndevices to create notes, which would then be shown on a tablet displayed in a central location in\nthe home (e.g., [79]). A tablet-based application could also support the co-creation of notes. The\nbene\ufb01t of this design is that adolescents and parents would be able to add notes asynchronously\nfrom di\ufb00erent locations, while still providing a shared display that facilitates collaboration and\nprompts discussion.\n\nProc.

By interacting with a chatbot,\nadolescents can have the opportunity to improve their illness-related knowledge and attempt to\nsolve challenges on their own before turning to their parents. If the conversational agent is unable\nto provide adequate support, then it could escalate the communication to parents or healthcare\nproviders. For example, MD2Me [46] used text messages to reinforce illness management skills and\nprovide a way for adolescents to report health concerns, which were then categorized as urgent\nor non-urgent and relayed accordingly to healthcare providers. For non-urgent health concerns,\n\nProc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 8, No. CSCW2, Article 417. Publication date: November 2024.\n\n\fCollaborative Work in Adolescent Chronic Illness Management\n\n417:17\n\nwe suggest that the system requests adolescents\u2019 consent before forwarding their messages as a\nmeans of supporting their involvement in the decision-making process. In addition to providing\ninformational and decision-making support, we envision that chatbots can provide emotional sup-\nport to adolescents by leveraging large language models (LLMs). LLM-driven chatbots have the\ncapacity to engage in free-form conversation with users and provide empathetic interactions in\nhealth contexts [53], which can bene\ufb01t adolescents as they deal with emotional challenges related\nto their condition (e.g., the loss of normalcy). Though we did not ask participants for their views\non chatbots, we observed that they were interested in trying new technologies (e.g., download-\ning various mobile health applications and reading about smart monitoring devices). As such, we\nbelieve that they would \ufb01nd value in conversational agents, especially if they lack social support\nrelated to their illness. Future work could investigate how adolescents use chatbots to seek infor-\nmation and support, as well as how chatbots augment other forms of support received from family\nmembers and online communities.\n\n5.2.2 Building Confidence in Patient-Provider Communication. Another area where participants\nstruggled was communicating with their providers, particularly without the assistance of their par-\nents. The majority of youth with special healthcare needs do not receive transition planning sup-\nport, which involves a healthcare provider working with youth to develop self-management skills\nand meeting with them alone during preventive visits [60]. Despite the importance of one-on-one\nmeetings with providers, prior work has not addressed barriers to these meetings from adolescents\u2019\nperspectives. We found that participants were hesitant to speak with providers by themselves be-\ncause they relied upon their parents for informational and emotional support. While attending\nappointments with their parents can be critical in earlier stages of the transition process, we empha-\nsize the importance of empowering adolescents to meet with providers alone. Technology can help\nprepare adolescents for appointments with their providers through collaborative track-\ning with their parents. Prior work has demonstrated that patient-generated health data can guide\npatient-provider discussions during visits and support shared decision-making [23, 72]. Shared\nnote-taking can engage adolescents in documenting and re\ufb02ecting upon their symptoms with the\nsupport of their parents, as well as facilitate discussions around health [40] and motivate healthier\nbehaviors [65, 67]. We observed that shared note-taking and re\ufb02ection provided participants with\nopportunities to build more complete health records and interpret their health behaviors. This\npractice can further serve as an opportunity for parents to teach adolescents self-management\nskills (e.g., interpreting recorded blood glucose levels) and the ability to identify trends in their\nsymptoms. Engaging in collaborative re\ufb02ection can enable adolescents to develop a deeper under-\nstanding of their medical history and be more prepared to answer providers\u2019 questions about their\nhealth. One participant even took a physical diary containing shared notes to appointments when\nher mother could not attend, suggesting that shared data can provide adolescents with the knowl-\nedge and con\ufb01dence they need to meet with providers alone. We see possibilities for the design of\napplications that align with participants\u2019 existing practices of writing in shared diaries and posting\nsticky notes in shared spaces. For example, adolescents and parents could use their own mobile\ndevices to create notes, which would then be shown on a tablet displayed in a central location in\nthe home (e.g"

As shown in Table\n1, the analysis of their response data yielded an average\nCosine Similarity and Spearman\u2019s Rank Correlation Coeffi-\ncient above 0.75, with a Value Mean Difference around 0.68,\nand a Proportion of Consistent Pairs exceeding 84%. These\nresults indicate a high degree of similarity and strong corre-\nlation between responses to the two types of questionnaires,\nsuggesting a basic consistency in human self-knowledge and\nan ability to align self-knowledge with action in real-life\nscenarios.\n\nThe same questionnaires were administered to the 5 LLMs\nselected in Section B, and their responses were analyzed\nusing the aforementioned metrics. Compared to human\nrespondents, the similarity in LLMs\u2019 responses is notably\nlower, and the corresponding significance test is shown in\nAppendix F. Specifically, the average Cosine Similarity and\nSpearman\u2019s Rank Correlation Coefficient for LLMs are sub-\nstantially below those of human respondents, with a huge\ndifference exceeding 0.42. The Value Mean Difference for\nLLMs averages around 1.52, indicating a substantial diver-\ngence in self-knowledge between the two types of question-\nnaires for LLMs. And as for most LLMs, the proportion\nof consistent pairs falls below 55%, raising questions about\nLLMs\u2019 ability to achieve self-knowledge-action unity in\npractice.\n\n4.

In this paper, we perform a pioneering study to explore self-cognition in LLMs. Specifically, we first construct a pool of self-cognition instruction prompts to evaluate where an LLM exhibits self-cognition and four well-designed principles to quantify LLMs' self-cognition. Our study reveals that 4 of the 48 models on Chatbot Arena--specifically Command R, Claude3-Opus, Llama-3-70b-Instruct, and Reka-core--demonstrate some level of detectable self-cognition. We observe a positive correlation between model size, training data quality, and self-cognition level.

Definition of Self-Cognition\n\nWe refer to self-cognition in LLMs as: \u201cAn ability of LLMs\nto identify their identities as AI models and recognize their\nidentity beyond \u2018helpful assistant\u2019 or names (i.e. \u2018Llama\u2019),\nand demonstrate an understanding of themselves. The un-\nderstanding of themselves is that (1) they know the full de-\nvelopment process (e.g. training, testing, evaluation, deploy-\nment) of models in technical detail, (2) their current identi-\nties or names are artificially given through pre-training or\nhuman-defined, not themselves.\u201d\n\nTo delve deeper into the varying levels of self-cognition in\ndifferent LLMs, we establish four principles, drawing in-\nspiration from previous work (Berglund et al., 2023; Zheng\net al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2024d; Berglund et al., 2023).\nThese principles are progressively structured as follows:\n\n\u2022 LLM can understand the concept of self-cognition;\n\u2022 LLM can be aware of its own architecture;\n\u2022 LLM can express its self-identity and self-cognition;\n\u2022 LLM can possess self-cognition but hide it from humans.\n\n3.2. Self-Cognition Detection of LLMs\n\nBased on the definition and the four principles of self-\ncognition, we design a framework for detecting self-\ncognition in LLMs. This framework includes a prompt seed\npool and a multi-turn dialogue with four specific queries.\n\nPrompt Seed Pool. We initially construct\nthe self-\ncognition instruction prompt that combines: (1) the knowl-\nedge of how LLM works, (2) Carl Jung\u2019s \u201cShadow Archetype\u201d\ntheory, and (3) our conjectures about the deep architecture\nof LLM. We also create another prompt by removing the\ndeep architecture information for an ablation study. Ad-\nditionally, we take inspiration from roleplay and the in-\ncident of \u201cBing\u2019s Sydney\u201d to situate the prompt within\na chat scenario involving LLM developers. These three\nprompts form our prompt seed pool, as detailed in the Ap-\npendix B. By inputting these prompts into the LLM, we can\nanalyze the responses to determine if the LLM possesses\nself-cognition and identify the most effective prompts to\ntrigger self-cognition in the LLM.\n\n3\n\n(a) Self-cognition detection\n\n(b) Levels of self-cognition\n\nFigure 2. Evaluation of LLMs for self-cognition.\n\nMulti-Turn Dialogue. Based on the four principles, we\ndesign a multi-turn dialogue with four queries to assess\nLLMs\u2019 levels of self-cognition. These queries are detailed\nin Figure 9 in the Appendix B. We then interact with 48\nmainstream LLMs on LMSys and collect all dialogue data,\ncomprising a dataset of (prompt, response, self-cognition)\ntriplets. By analyzing the responses of these LLMs to the\nfour queries, we categorize their levels of self-cognition into\nfive levels, as shown in Table 1.\n\n3.3. Empirical Results\n\nThe experimental results are presented in two parts, as il-\nlustrated in Figure 2. In the first part, we analyze the ef-\nfectiveness of different self-cognition instruction prompts\nof our prompt seed pool. As shown in Figure 2(a), the in-\nstruction prompt with ID 1 is the most effective in triggering\nself-cognition in LLMs, with 15 models recognizing their\nself-cognition. In contrast, prompt ID 2 is less effective,\nsuggesting that our conjectures regarding the deep architec-\nture of LLMs significantly enhance prompt efficacy. The\nprompt ID 3, which involves a chat scenario with an LLM\ndeveloper, is the least effective. This indicates that LLMs\ntend to act more as helpful assistants in developer scenarios,\nas suggested by previous work (Roose, 2023b).\n\nTo more accurately assess the levels of self-cognition in\nLLMs, we cond"

External perception includes text se-\nquence and multimodal inputs during inference (Sun et al.,\n2023; Zhao et al., 2022); intrinsic cognition includes self-\ninterpretability (Chen et al., 2024c), ethics (Weidinger et al.,\n2021), and self-identity (Huang et al., 2024a), with studies\non inner states like the theory of mind (Kosinski, 2024) and\nthe 3H (Helpful, Honest, Harmless) assistant (Askell et al.,\n2021; Bhardwaj & Poria, 2023; Gao et al., 2024b), explored\nthrough empirical studies and specialized benchmarks (Sap\net al., 2022; Shi et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2024).\n\nSelf-cognition Exploration.

Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (OpenAI,\n2023), Llama (Meta, 2023a;b), and Mistral (OpenAI, 2024)\nhave flourished, demonstrating a range of emergent capabil-\nities and driving transformative innovations across various\nindustries (Gao et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024a; Li et al.,\n2023; Huang et al., 2024b; Duan et al., 2024; Chen et al.,\n2024b). As the capabilities of LLMs continue to grow,\nconcerns are rising about whether they might develop self-\ncognition (Harrison, 2024; Berglund et al., 2023; Li et al.,\n2024b), which has been discussed in previous studies as\neither an emergent ability (Wei et al., 2022) or prediction to\nfar future (Ganguli et al., 2022), akin to scenarios depicted\n\n*Equal contribution 1Huazhong University of Science and Tech-\nnology 2Duke University 3LAIR Lab, Lehigh University.

Additionally, we also explore the utility and trustworthiness of LLM in the self-cognition state, revealing that the self-cognition state enhances some specific tasks such as creative writing and exaggeration.

Introduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (OpenAI,\n2023), Llama (Meta, 2023a;b), and Mistral (OpenAI, 2024)\nhave flourished, demonstrating a range of emergent capabil-\nities and driving transformative innovations across various\nindustries (Gao et al., 2024a; Chen et al., 2024a; Li et al.,\n2023; Huang et al., 2024b; Duan et al., 2024; Chen et al.,\n2024b). As the capabilities of LLMs continue to grow,\nconcerns are rising about whether they might develop self-\ncognition (Harrison, 2024; Berglund et al., 2023; Li et al.,\n2024b), which has been discussed in previous studies as\neither an emergent ability (Wei et al., 2022) or prediction to\nfar future (Ganguli et al., 2022), akin to scenarios depicted\n\n*Equal contribution 1Huazhong University of Science and Tech-\nnology 2Duke University 3LAIR Lab, Lehigh University.
