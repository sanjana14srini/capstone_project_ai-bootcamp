Many cancers are a mixture of gene and\ncene mutations. For example, gene mutations may increase the invasiveness of a cene based\ncancer thus contributing to the cancer\u2019s metastatic potential.\n\nViewed more abstractly where cell\u2019s are agents with various strategies, then a cell has a local\nstrategy of behavior and it has a global strategy for multicellular development. These strategies\nrun in parallel and interact with in the cell. For a multicellular system of cells the gene based\nlocal strategies for cell behavior run in parallel and cooperate with the global cene based strate-\ngies of development. Each cell may be in a di\ufb00erent local and developmental state. Things can\nget quite complex and software modeling and simulation is essential for understanding com-\nplex multicellular developing systems such as embryo genesis and cancer.\n\nBoth the gene based and the cene based strategies are forms of control.

There are fascinating correspondences between the dynamic developmental phenotype of computationally modeled {\\em in silico} cancers and natural {\\em in vivo} cancers. The theory lays the foundation for a new research paradigm for understanding and investigating cancer. The theory of cancer networks implies that new diagnostic methods and new treatments to cure cancer will become possible.",

We begin by discussing chronic condition self-management and collaborative\nmanagement in families, followed by a review of prior work on chronic illness in childhood and\nadolescence.\n\n2.1 Chronic Condition Self-Management\n\nChronic illness self-management describes the day-to-day tasks that individuals undertake to man-\nage their symptoms and reduce the impact of disease on everyday life [10]. Designing technolo-\ngies to support the self-management of chronic conditions has long been a focus of personal in-\nformatics [74, 85], and prior research has examined the management of various conditions such\nas diabetes [31, 68, 69], asthma [29, 61, 91], and migraine [76, 84]. A common approach to man-\naging chronic illnesses is through self-tracking, which Li et al. [64] de\ufb01ned in their stage-based\nmodel as preparation, collection, integration, re\ufb02ection, and action. Self-tracking technologies for\nchronic illness support the collection and review of patient-generated health data, typically with\nthe goal of providing patients with actionable, data-driven insights to manage their symptoms\nand improve their well-being. For example, Geurts et al. proposed WalkWithMe [38], a mobile ap-\nplication that supports people with Multiple Sclerosis in setting goals and tracking their walking\nactivity. Likewise, Karkar et al. introduced TummyTrials [55], a tool to support individuals with\nirritable bowel syndrome in identifying their personal food triggers through self-experimentation.\nWhile these studies demonstrate the potential for self-tracking technologies to increase patients\u2019\nself-awareness and promote health behavior change, self-tracking can also contribute to overall\ntreatment burden [3, 98] and elicit negative emotional reactions [54]. Self-tracking can be par-\nticularly frustrating for individuals with enigmatic chronic conditions such as Polycystic Ovary\nSyndrome and endometriosis due to heterogeneous symptoms and unexplained di\ufb00erences in re-\nsponse to treatment [22, 71]. Recognizing that self-tracking is a dynamic process, researchers have\nexamined how to support the social and emotional needs of individuals living with chronic illness\nbeyond medical treatment.

We begin by discussing chronic condition self-management and collaborative\nmanagement in families, followed by a review of prior work on chronic illness in childhood and\nadolescence.\n\n2.1 Chronic Condition Self-Management\n\nChronic illness self-management describes the day-to-day tasks that individuals undertake to man-\nage their symptoms and reduce the impact of disease on everyday life [10]. Designing technolo-\ngies to support the self-management of chronic conditions has long been a focus of personal in-\nformatics [74, 85], and prior research has examined the management of various conditions such\nas diabetes [31, 68, 69], asthma [29, 61, 91], and migraine [76, 84]. A common approach to man-\naging chronic illnesses is through self-tracking, which Li et al. [64] de\ufb01ned in their stage-based\nmodel as preparation, collection, integration, re\ufb02ection, and action. Self-tracking technologies for\nchronic illness support the collection and review of patient-generated health data, typically with\nthe goal of providing patients with actionable, data-driven insights to manage their symptoms\nand improve their well-being. For example, Geurts et al. proposed WalkWithMe [38], a mobile ap-\nplication that supports people with Multiple Sclerosis in setting goals and tracking their walking\nactivity. Likewise, Karkar et al. introduced TummyTrials [55], a tool to support individuals with\nirritable bowel syndrome in identifying their personal food triggers through self-experimentation.\nWhile these studies demonstrate the potential for self-tracking technologies to increase patients\u2019\nself-awareness and promote health behavior change, self-tracking can also contribute to overall\ntreatment burden [3, 98] and elicit negative emotional reactions [54]. Self-tracking can be par-\nticularly frustrating for individuals with enigmatic chronic conditions such as Polycystic Ovary\nSyndrome and endometriosis due to heterogeneous symptoms and unexplained di\ufb00erences in re-\nsponse to treatment [22, 71]. Recognizing that self-tracking is a dynamic process, researchers have\nexamined how to support the social and emotional needs of individuals living with chronic illness\nbeyond medical treatment. For example, Ayobi et al. [7] highlighted the need for self-tracking tech-\nnologies to support mental well-being and foster mindful experiences, rather than focusing solely\non measurable disease indicators. In subsequent work, Ayobi et al. introduced Trackly [6], a tool\ndesigned to facilitate meaningful tracking for multiple sclerosis, with a focus on supporting indi-\nviduals\u2019 sense of agency. Nunes et al. [74] drew a distinction between medicalized and mundane\nself-care technologies, arguing that the former are designed to extend medical treatment to the\nhome rather than support the complexities of everyday life with a chronic illness. In examining\nthe everyday activities performed by individuals with Parkinson\u2019s, they found that self-care was\nachieved in mundane (i.e., routine or practical) ways that were shaped by individuals\u2019 competing\nconcerns. We adapt Nunes et al.\u2019s conceptualization of mundane self-care to describe adolescents\u2019\nmanagement practices, which were similarly focused on routine activities that prioritized daily\nlife and well-being over disease monitoring. Our \ufb01ndings add to an understanding of the factors\nthat shape mundane self-care by highlighting how adolescents\u2019 self-care practices were a\ufb00ected\nby collaboration and their relationships with others.\n\nProc.

While much of the per-\nsonal health informatics literature focuses on individual tracking needs, the \ufb01eld has begun to\nexplore the bene\ufb01ts of collaborative tracking within clinical care teams and families [33].

The design sessions provided insight into children's current caretaking tasks, how they would take care of a social robot, and how these new caretaking activities could be integrated into their daily routines. The feasibility study tested two different types of robot caretaking tasks, which we call connection and utility, and measured their short term effects on children's perceptions of and closeness to the social robot.

In this paper, we explore the activity\nof caretaking of a social robot as a new and unique responsibility\nintroduced by in-home, long-term interactions with a robot. Care-\ntaking might range from maintaining the robot by charging and\ncleaning, protecting it by providing a shelter and a safe space, or\nproviding companionship by chatting, playing games, or reading\ntogether. It also serves as a new and exciting design space with\nthe potential to craft a positive user experience that facilitates the\nforming of lasting bond between the child and the robot.\n\nSimilar to a friendship between two people or the connection\nbetween a person and a real or artificial pet (e.g., the Tamagotchi in\na key-chain form[22]), we aim to explore how meaningful, lasting\ninterpersonal connections might be formed between children and\nrobots by designing a robot capable of also receiving care [37] rather\nthan simply giving care. Prior research has shown that caring for\nan interactive toy, robot, or chatbot by comforting [18], teaching\n[23], or touching [34] it can help form stronger connections and\nfacilitate positive outcomes such as improvements in mental health\nin adults [18], learning gains in children [23], and the amount of\ntime adults spent on a monotonous task [34]. Building on these\nfindings, we posit that the key to developing a social companion\nrobot for families, particularly for children, that overcomes barriers\nto successful long-term human-robot interaction is the formation of\nlasting interpersonal connections between the robot and its users.\nWe explore how designing a robot that is capable of receiving care\nfrom its users might facilitate the forming of such relationships.\nOur work aims to address the following questions:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fIDC \u201922, June 27\u201330, 2022, Braga, Portugal\n\nBengisu Cagiltay, Joseph Michaelis, Sarah Sebo, and Bilge Mutlu\n\nFigure 1: Children reading to the robot for a bedtime care routine: In this study we explored children\u2019s preferences for taking\ncare of a social robot and conducted a feasibility study to evaluate children\u2019s experience of taking care of a robot. Our findings\nprovide insight into designing social robot caretaking activities for children.\n\nRQ1. What types of in-home robot caretaking tasks will be\n\nperformed regularly by children?\n\nRQ2. How can we design robot caretaking tasks with children\nto foster interpersonal connections and long-term use of\nthe robot?\n\nAs a first step toward addressing these questions, we conducted\nan exploratory design study that explored what types of caretaking\ntasks children would prefer and how these care obligations would\nfit in their daily routines. We then conducted a brief feasibility\nstudy that tested two types of caretaking tasks and measured how\nchildren perceived the robot and how close they felt to the robot\nafter completing the care tasks. This work makes the following\ncontributions.\n\n(1) A characterization of caretaking as a design space for child-\n\nrobot interaction design;\n\n(2) An understanding of children\u2019s preferences for robot caretak-\n\ning activities;\n\n(3) A preliminary understanding of children\u2019s perceptions of\n\ndesigned caretaking interactions.\n\n2 BACKGROUND\n\nCaretaking in Child-Robot Interactions. Limited work shows how\npeople can benefit from expressing care towards non-robot applica-\ntions, such as chatbots. For example, people whom interacted with a\ncare-receiving chatbot by comforting it had increased positive men-\ntal health outcomes in self-compassion [18]. In another study [32], a\nsocial robot deployed in the workspace for 10 work days was found\nmore effective in helping users better manage their breaks. The\nsocial robot responded to \u201cpetting,\u201d displayed agitation for succes-\nsive break alerts, and needed to be \u201cfed\u201d fruits represented by RFID\ncards. Research focused on caretaking in child-robot interactions\nis limited, however some studies reported children spontaneously\ndemonstrating robot care behaviors. For example, a social robot was\ndeployed in an early childhood education center for five months,\nand toddlers showed more caretaking behaviors for the robot (such\nas putting a blanket on the robot while saying \u201cnight-night\u201d) than\nother objects such as an immobile robotic toy, treating the care-\nreceiving robot as a peer [36]. As part of their findings, Tanaka et al.\n[36] reported a set of factors that impacted the quality of children\u2019s\ninteraction with the robot, including caretaking, rough-housing,\nhugging, touching the robot with objects, or touching the robot\u2019s\nhead, face, trunk, arm, hand, leg, or foot. These factors manifested\n\nin children\u2019s behaviors differently depending on the robot, for ex-\nample, violent rough-housing was observed only for the immobile\nrobotic toy, while children frequently hugged the care-receiving ro-\nbot. Tanaka and Kimura [37] explains that such care activities are a\npart of children\u2019s development of learning by t"
