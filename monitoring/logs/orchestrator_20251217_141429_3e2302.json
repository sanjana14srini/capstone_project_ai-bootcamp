Previous studies have shown a great variation in the SRB across geographic locations in India till 2016. As one of the most populous countries and in view of its great regional heterogeneity, it is crucial to produce probabilistic projections for the SRB in India at state level for the purpose of population projection and policy planning. In this paper, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical time series model to project SRB in India by state. We generate SRB probabilistic projections from 2017 to 2030 for 29 States and Union Territories (UTs) in India, and present results in 21 States/UTs with data from the Sample Registration System. Our analysis takes into account two state-specific factors that contribute to sex-selective abortion and resulting sex imbalances at birth: intensity of son preference and fertility squeeze. We project that the largest contribution to female births deficits is in Uttar Pradesh, with cumulative number of missing female births projected to be 2.0 (95% credible interval [1.9; 2.2]) million from 2017 to 2030. The total female birth deficits during 2017-2030 for the whole India is projected to be 6.8 [6.6; 7.0] million.",

Previous studies have shown a great variation in the SRB across geographic locations in India till 2016. As one of the most populous countries and in view of its great regional heterogeneity, it is crucial to produce probabilistic projections for the SRB in India at state level for the purpose of population projection and policy planning. In this paper, we implement a Bayesian hierarchical time series model to project SRB in India by state. We generate SRB probabilistic projections from 2017 to 2030 for 29 States and Union Territories (UTs) in India, and present results in 21 States/UTs with data from the Sample Registration System. Our analysis takes into account two state-specific factors that contribute to sex-selective abortion and resulting sex imbalances at birth: intensity of son preference and fertility squeeze. We project that the largest contribution to female births deficits is in Uttar Pradesh, with cumulative number of missing female births projected to be 2.0 (95% credible interval [1.9; 2.2]) million from 2017 to 2030. The total female birth deficits during 2017-2030 for the whole India is projected to be 6.8 [6.6; 7.0] million.",

In the\nend, we conclude we need to collect more data as it would be\nmore interesting to have data on the Internet peering disputes\naround the world.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Internet can arguably be called as the most spectacular\ntechnological artifact of our times that has emerged from a\ndistributed, uncoordinated, spontaneous interaction of many\n[1] and the rapid emergence of the Internet has even amazed\nthe people responsible for its creation. It has shrunk the world\nbeyond the limitations posed by politics, culture, and physical\nboundaries of nations. Its importance is evident from the\nfact that the United Nations have considered making access\nto the Internet as human right. The unit of a network is\nan Autonomous System (AS). Today\u2019s Internet comprises of\naround 65,516 (as of March 30, 2014) Autonomous Systems\n(ASes) [2] administering thousands of network computing\nthe ASes are connected to each other using\ndevices. All\nthe Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP) to provide\nconnectivity to the end users.\n\nBusiness relationships among Autonomous Systems is es-\nsential for the connectivity provided by the Internet, which is\nmainly of two kinds. 1) Transit: Relationship wherein one AS\nacts as a customer and takes services, of what is called its\nprovider, to get the connectivity to the rest of the Internet.\nTo ensure connectivity to the Internet, establishing transit\nrelationships is necessary and the customer must pay monthly\nbills to the provider. 2) Peering: When two ASes see a mutual\nbene\ufb01t to save the transit costs, i.e., instead of paying to the\ntransit provider, they establish a connection among themselves\nto exchange each others traf\ufb01c. Note that it can be established\nonly among two ASes such that none can be the provider\nof the other. If one could be provider, it will not engage in\npayment free peering.\n\nPeering can further be classi\ufb01ed into two categories, public\nand private Peering. IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) facilitate\nconnection between two ASes by providing them the necessary\ninfrastructure. When two ASes peer at an IXP, it can be termed\n\nas public peering. A peering is private if two ASes deploy their\nown infrastructure to connect to each other. It is often cost\neffective to peer at IXP because all the necessary infrastructure\nis already there.\n\nSince peering happens for mutual bene\ufb01t, none of the ASes\ncan take unfair advantage. For example, one AS may inject\nmuch more traf\ufb01c on the peering link than the other. If is\noften measured as peering traf\ufb01c ratio, which is de\ufb01ned as\nout:in and should not exceed 2:1. Any imbalance often results\nin what is known as peering dispute.\n\nDe\ufb01nition 1 (peering dispute): We classify all the events as\ndisputes in which a con\ufb02ict between two peers leads to the\ntermination or warning of termination of the peering link, from\nany one of them, even for a short period of time.\n\nIt may be noted that 500 to 1000 small de-peerings occur\ndaily [3], but we do not consider them as disputes. These\nde-peerings mainly occur due to technical incapabilities or\nnegligence in maintaining peering links using BGP. So, we\nconsider a de-peering event as a dispute only when there is\na con\ufb02ict of interest between the parties or there is a claim\nmade for the breach of the peering agreement from at least\none of the involved parties.\n\nPeering disputes are not mare concern of the two involved\nASes. It affects a lot bigger region depending upon the AS.\nAn AS is in tier-1 if it has no transit provider. Hence, it does\nnot pay to anyone for transit but rather forms a peering mesh\nwith the other tier-1 ASes. Hence, as we will see later in the\npaper, depeering can fragment the Internet and leave the end\nusers disconnected from the other part. It impacts BGP routing\nand its convergence.\n\nA. Our Contribution\n\nIn this paper, we aim to understand the Internet peering\ndisputes that disturb the connectivity of the Internet and\noften result in end users sufferings. We collected disputes\nfrom various sources including blogs, news, mailing lists like\nNANOG, etc. We do a \ufb01rst detailed analysis of "

              "content": "the nature of\nsuch disputes. Some of our contributions can be summarized\nas:\n\n\u2022 We collected 26 Internet peering disputes that have oc-\ncurred since the Internet was commercialized, including\nthe ASes involved, reason and duration of disputes.\n\u2022 We give a general classi\ufb01cation for the disputes in which\n\nthey can be categorized.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f\u2022 We give temporal distribution of disputes since its com-\nmercial inception until today and geographical distribu-\ntion according to different Internet Regions.\n\nSuch a study is crucial in understanding the evolution of the\nInternet and predict a dispute that may happen in future.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II\ndiscusses the related work, Section III describes the methodol-\nogy behind our data collection and explains the collected data,\nSection IV presents the inferences and Section V concludes\nthe paper with potential future work to be done.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\n\nInternet peering relationships have always been the source\nof confusion among researchers. However, a very little about\nthem is known [4]. Moreover peering involves skills beyond\ntechnology [5]. Peering disputes have been talked about in\nliterature before [6] [7] and their importance acknowledged\n[8] [9]. As far as we know, there is not much in the literature\non concretely studying the disputes themselves. Our work\npresents the \ufb01rst work in such a direction.\n\nIII. DATA COLLECTION\n\nIn this section, we describe the methodology to gather\npeering dispute data. We describe the data that we have\ncollected and later classify it according to different disputes.\n\nA. Methodology\n\nIn the absence of any literature, we started exploring news\nand mailing lists like NANOG. By the time we had \ufb01nished,\nwe had explored the Internet for peering disputes. We found\nmaximum disputes in the region of North America, which was\nexpected. We searched the mail archives of all the Internet Re-\ngional Registries. We also posted mails on discussion forums\nof all the Internet Regional Registries (NANOG, APNIC, RIPE\nNCC, AfriNIC and LACNIC) asking for more information\non the peering and peering disputes we collected and also\nsome new disputes. To widen our search for disputes in other\nparts of the world we used keywords in regional languages for\nour search. We translated the keywords that could potentially\ngive us news on depeerings in local news. For example, we\nsearched in Spanish and Portuguese in Latin America, Italian\nin Italy, French in France and so on.\n\nB. Data Collected\n\nIn total we collected information about 26 peering disputes\nfrom all our sources. We were not surprised to collect only\n26 disputes because most of the Internet Interconnection\nAgreements are very quite affair and are not documented for,\nthey are mostly handshake agreements where parties mutually\nagree without any on record documentation. This argument\nis supported by the fact that 141,512 Internet Interconnection\nAgreements out of 142,210 Internet Agreements examined till\nMarch 2011 were Handshake Agreements [10].\n\nIn TABLE I we have listed all the information on different\npeering disputes we collected, in the descending order on\nthe basis of Month/Year. In these 26 collected disputes we\n\nFig. 1. Classi\ufb01cation of the Peering Disputes Collected\n\nhave covered a wide spectrum of the Internet, from the early\ncommercial phase to the current phase, the earliest peering\ndispute in our table is of Oct\u201994 and the most recent one is\nof July\u201913. Here, we would like to mention that we collected\ninformation on a more recent dispute anticipation [11] but,\nwe have not included this in our list because this is just a\nprediction.\n\nIn the table, we have mentioned the reason for all the\ncollected disputes barring a few, the reasons we mentioned are\nmostly based on the public statements made by the concerned\ncompanies.\n\nIn some of the peering disputes collected, we could not\n\ufb01nd the exact month/year so we have mentioned the period\nbased on some evidences. For example, dispute no. 23, 24\nand 25 have their root at the CIX router (Commercial Internet\neXchange, \ufb01rst IXP in USA). CIX was established in \u201991\nand NSFNET reverted back to research network in \u201995 [12].\nDispute no. 21 happened because AGIS announced its new\npeering policy at the NANOG meeting held at the University\nof Michigan [13], possibly NANOG 8 held in Oct\u201996 [14].\nThe period of dispute no. 17 and 18 was estimated based on\nthe fact that exodus (involved in 17) \ufb01led for bankruptcy in\n2001 [15] and MCI/Worldcom (involved in 18) merged in \u201998\n[16].\n\nC. Classi\ufb01cation of disputes\n\nBased on the similarities between the nature of disputes, we\nclassifying them as mentioned below and as shown in Fig. 1.\nIt is possible that one dispute may belong to more than one\nclassi\ufb01cation but we put them in exactly one, giving the reason\nfor our choice.\n\n1) Imbalance Traf\ufb01c Ratio: Dispute no. 11, 13 and 15 are\nsimilar kind of disputes, the reason for these disputes is breach\nof imbalanced traf\ufb01c ratio, i.e. one of the pla"

              "content": "g. 2 represents the disputes collected year wise. Looking\n\nFig. 2. No. of Peering Disputes collected in each year\n\nat Fig. 2 it can be noticed there are more number of disputes\nuntil 1998, at the rate of at least once per year. There are\nlesser number of collected disputes during 1999 to 2006 and\nthen again it rises. We have no data of peering disputes\nin \u201998 , \u201904 and \u201906. This doesn\u2019t mean that no peering\ndisputes have taken place in these durations. Typically, such\ndisputes are closed door, proprietary agreements, the details\nof peering arrangements are handled as trade secrets, and no\nparty bene\ufb01ts from publicly airing grievances.\n\nIf we nibble a little bit more on this then we can see that\nthe increase in number of players can be one of the reasons\nfor the increase in frequency of peering disputes. The earlier\npeering disputes like, that of Sprint, BBN and AGIS with\nother ISPs [13] were mainly due to technical constraints or\nissues at the CIX Router and the disputes of the modern time\nlike, that of Cogent with Sprint [27], Telia [17] and Level3\n[18] [33] are due the imbalanced traf\ufb01c ratio. This shows\nthat the spotlight has shifted from technological constraints\nto economics. Technology is no longer a constraint as it used\nto be and now the major \ufb01ght is for the share of the revenue\nthat others are generating from the concerned peering link.\n\nB. Geographical Location\n\nBased on the geographical\n\nlocation we have classi\ufb01ed\npeering disputes data in 5 regions. These regions are based\non Regional Internet Registries, i.e. Asia Paci\ufb01c (APNIC),\n\n\ffor these disputes was the customer base of France Telecom\n[23] [22].\n\nIt may be noted that in the bar graph there are no disputes\nmentioned in the region of Africa and Latin America, this\nshould not be taken as fact that no disputes took place in these\nregions. We could not \ufb01nd them maybe because they were not\npublicized or they were in the regional languages. We put in\nour best efforts to \ufb01nd as many disputes by searching in the\nregional languages but for these two regions we were not able\nto \ufb01nd any dispute.\n\nC. Players Involved\n\nIn the TABLE I there are some players that are involved\nin more then one dispute. In Fig. 4, we have classi\ufb01ed these\nplayers based on the number of disputes they are involved in.\nPlease note that we have considered only those companies\nthat are involved in more then one dispute based on the\ndata collected. The points in the graph denote the number\nof disputes each of these players are involved in.\n\nFig. 4. Players involved in more than one Peering Dispute\n\nCogent that is involved in maximum of the peering disputes\ncollected by us carries a reputation of getting into peering\nbattles more often then others. So whenever there is a peering\ncontroversy the \ufb01rst question that is being asked very fre-\nquently is, \u201dIs Cogent involved?\u201d As mentioned in [30] Cogent\nis best known for two things, cheap bandwidth and peering\ncontroversies. But this certainly doesn\u2019t make Cogent a bad\nplayer in the market, one view point of this can be that if you\nare providing a service at cheaper rates then others then you\nare bound to get in \ufb01ghts, it\u2019s a competitive market out there.\nThere are players in Fig. 4 that were actually involved in a\ndispute with each other, the two disputes in which FT-Orange\nwas involved in are with Cogent, so these two disputes have\nbeen counted twice.\n\nIt is evident that peering disputes are increasing gradually\n[3] more and more players are getting involved because\nboundaries are changing, there was a time when there were\nclear distinctions between access ISPs, transit or backbone\nISPs, content providers and content delivery networks but over\nthe course of time these distinctions are going extinct, now\nmany companies are in different \ufb01elds and this has made the\nmarket very competitive and this makes these disputes even\nstronger. The same argument is supported by the statement\nof Cogent CEO, Dave Schaeffer in [11] where he explains\nthat why his company is involved in so many of peering\n\nFig. 3. No. of Peering Disputes based on Geographical Location\n\nEurope and Middle East (RIPE NCC), Africa (AfriNIC), Latin\nAmerica (LACNIC) and North America (ARIN).\n\nFrom Fig. 3, it is safe to say that most of the peering\ndisputes are concentrated in the region of North America or\nto say in a more precise manner, the United States. One can\nmake many inferences out of this like, Does this mean that\nthere are less number of disputes in other regions? or Does\nthis mean that Internet Activity is less in other regions? We\nhave no answer to such questions right now. To be on the safer\nside, we assume that they are missing from our data.\n\nThe reason according to us for this polarity is two fold,\none is that Internet originated in United States, i.e. the core\nof the Internet was formed there and others just joined an\nalready existing network, the presence of majority of Tier-1\nAses (ASes that are on the top of AS hierarchy and do not\npay to anyone for transit"

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Internet can arguably be called as the most spectacular\ntechnological artifact of our times that has emerged from a\ndistributed, uncoordinated, spontaneous interaction of many\n[1] and the rapid emergence of the Internet has even amazed\nthe people responsible for its creation. It has shrunk the world\nbeyond the limitations posed by politics, culture, and physical\nboundaries of nations. Its importance is evident from the\nfact that the United Nations have considered making access\nto the Internet as human right. The unit of a network is\nan Autonomous System (AS). Today\u2019s Internet comprises of\naround 65,516 (as of March 30, 2014) Autonomous Systems\n(ASes) [2] administering thousands of network computing\nthe ASes are connected to each other using\ndevices. All\nthe Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP) to provide\nconnectivity to the end users.\n\nBusiness relationships among Autonomous Systems is es-\nsential for the connectivity provided by the Internet, which is\nmainly of two kinds. 1) Transit: Relationship wherein one AS\nacts as a customer and takes services, of what is called its\nprovider, to get the connectivity to the rest of the Internet.\nTo ensure connectivity to the Internet, establishing transit\nrelationships is necessary and the customer must pay monthly\nbills to the provider. 2) Peering: When two ASes see a mutual\nbene\ufb01t to save the transit costs, i.e., instead of paying to the\ntransit provider, they establish a connection among themselves\nto exchange each others traf\ufb01c. Note that it can be established\nonly among two ASes such that none can be the provider\nof the other. If one could be provider, it will not engage in\npayment free peering.\n\nPeering can further be classi\ufb01ed into two categories, public\nand private Peering. IXPs (Internet Exchange Points) facilitate\nconnection between two ASes by providing them the necessary\ninfrastructure. When two ASes peer at an IXP, it can be termed\n\nas public peering. A peering is private if two ASes deploy their\nown infrastructure to connect to each other. It is often cost\neffective to peer at IXP because all the necessary infrastructure\nis already there.\n\nSince peering happens for mutual bene\ufb01t, none of the ASes\ncan take unfair advantage. For example, one AS may inject\nmuch more traf\ufb01c on the peering link than the other. If is\noften measured as peering traf\ufb01c ratio, which is de\ufb01ned as\nout:in and should not exceed 2:1. Any imbalance often results\nin what is known as peering dispute.\n\nDe\ufb01nition 1 (peering dispute): We classify all the events as\ndisputes in which a con\ufb02ict between two peers leads to the\ntermination or warning of termination of the peering link, from\nany one of them, even for a short period of time.\n\nIt may be noted that 500 to 1000 small de-peerings occur\ndaily [3], but we do not consider them as disputes. These\nde-peerings mainly occur due to technical incapabilities or\nnegligence in maintaining peering links using BGP. So, we\nconsider a de-peering event as a dispute only when there is\na con\ufb02ict of interest between the parties or there is a claim\nmade for the breach of the peering agreement from at least\none of the involved parties.\n\nPeering disputes are not mare concern of the two involved\nASes. It affects a lot bigger region depending upon the AS.\nAn AS is in tier-1 if it has no transit provider. Hence, it does\nnot pay to anyone for transit but rather forms a peering mesh\nwith the other tier-1 ASes. Hence, as we will see later in the\npaper, depeering can fragment the Internet and leave the end\nusers disconnected from the other part. It impacts BGP routing\nand its convergence.\n\nA. Our Contribution\n\nIn this paper, we aim to understand the Internet peering\ndisputes that disturb the connectivity of the Internet and\noften result in end users sufferings. We collected disputes\nfrom various sources including blogs, news, mailing lists like\nNANOG, etc. We do a \ufb01rst detailed analysis of "

              "content": " performance on common QA datasets in-\n\n\fcluding NQ-Open, TriviaQA, OPQA, and STRAT-\nEGYQA. This focus overlooks the broader implica-\ntions of knowledge conflicts, particularly how they\ninfluence downstream tasks. Exploring the effects\nof knowledge conflicts on a wider range of appli-\ncations beyond QA problems could yield insights\ninto creating more robust and reliable models. For\ninstance, in tasks requiring high levels of accu-\nracy and consistency, such as legal document anal-\nysis (Shui et al., 2023; Martin et al., 2024), medi-\ncal diagnosis (Zhou et al., 2023b; Thirunavukarasu\net al., 2023), financial analysis (Zhang et al., 2023a;\nLi et al., 2023e) and educational tools (Caines et al.,\n2023; Milano et al., 2023), the presence of unre-\nsolved knowledge conflicts could undermine the\nmodel\u2019s utility.\n\nInterplay among the Conflicts. Current research\nin the knowledge conflict of LLMs primarily con-\ncentrates on investigating conflicts of a singular\ntype (Wang et al., 2023h; Chen et al., 2022; Li\net al., 2023d) or a joint study of inter-context and\ncontext-memory conflict (Jin et al., 2024a; Xie\net al., 2023). However, there is a notable dearth of\nresearch on the interaction between intra-memory\nconflict and the other two types of conflicts. Several\npapers have proposed the existence of knowledge\ncircuits in LLMs (Chughtai et al., 2024; Huang\net al., 2023), which are closely related to the intra-\nmemory conflict. Addressing this gap is crucial\nfor understanding the relationship between the in-\nternal knowledge inconsistency of the model and\nits behavior in response to the context. Moreover,\nexploring the synergistic effects of various con-\nflict types could unveil underlying mechanisms of\nknowledge representation and processing in LLMs\nand help us to develop more robust and accurate\nLLMs in practice.\n\nExplainability. Most recent work analyzed LLMs\u2019\nbehaviors amidst knowledge conflicts at the out-\nput level (Xie et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023h).\nWhile some studies have observed and explored\nthe model\u2019s confidence in its output, i.e., logits (Xu\net al., 2023; Jin et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b),\nthere has been less focus on the internal mechanism\nof the model, like specific attention heads or neuron\nactivations during conflicts. This gap highlights a\nneed for more microscopic examinations to better\ncomprehend how models decide when encounter\nconflicts. A recent study conducted by Jin et al.\n(2024b) advances this by investigating the inter-\npretability of LLMs through information flow anal-\n\nysis, pinpointing pivotal points for conflict mitiga-\ntion. They discover there are some attention heads\nwith opposite effects in the later layers, where mem-\nory heads can recall knowledge from internal mem-\nory, and context heads can retrieve knowledge from\nthe external context. Inspired by this, Pruning Head\nvia Path Patching is introduced to resolve conflicts\nefficiently without updating model parameters.\n\nMultilinguality. To date, research on knowledge\nconflict has primarily focused on the English lan-\nguage. Future studies could expand in two di-\nrections. Firstly, by examining LLMs to address\nknowledge conflicts in non-English prompts, lever-\naging the many advanced non-English models avail-\nable (e.g., GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) for Chinese)\nor LLMs with multilingual capability (e.g., GPT-\n4 (OpenAI, 2024)) and noting differences from\nEnglish to account for unique language character-\nistics. Secondly, addressing inter-context conflict\nwhere multiple documents in different languages\nmight be retrieved, potentially involving cross-\nlanguage knowledge conflicts. Solutions could\ninclude employing translation systems (Demen-\ntieva and Panchenko, 2021) or, for low-resource\nlanguages, leveraging high-resource language evi-\ndence (Xue et al., 2024) or employing knowledge\ndistillation techniques.\n\nMultimodality. Current research on knowledge\nconflicts mainly focused on the text modality, leav-\ning the study of these conflicts in multimodal con-\ntexts as a promising area for future exploration. As\nLLMs evolve to process information across various\nformats\u2014images (Alayrac et al., 2022; Li et al.,\n2023b), video (Ju et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023b),\nand audio (Borsos et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023)\u2014\nthe potential for conflicts escalates in growing com-\nplexity. For instance, textual documents might\nclash with visual data, or the tone of an audio clip\nmight contradict the content of an accompanying\ncaption. Future research on multimodal knowledge\nconflicts could focus on crafting advanced LLMs\nskilled in cross-modal reasoning and conflict reso-\nlution across diverse data types. This effort neces-\nsitates the enhancement of models\u2019 capabilities to\nnavigate the complex dynamics between different\nmodalities and the development of targeted datasets\nfor effective training and evaluation. Additionally,\nexploring how users perceive and manage multi-\nmodal conflicts, such as discrepancies between text\nand images, will offer valuable i"

However, there is a notable dearth of\nresearch on the interaction between intra-memory\nconflict and the other two types of conflicts. Several\npapers have proposed the existence of knowledge\ncircuits in LLMs (Chughtai et al., 2024; Huang\net al., 2023), which are closely related to the intra-\nmemory conflict. Addressing this gap is crucial\nfor understanding the relationship between the in-\nternal knowledge inconsistency of the model and\nits behavior in response to the context. Moreover,\nexploring the synergistic effects of various con-\nflict types could unveil underlying mechanisms of\nknowledge representation and processing in LLMs\nand help us to develop more robust and accurate\nLLMs in practice.\n\nExplainability. Most recent work analyzed LLMs\u2019\nbehaviors amidst knowledge conflicts at the out-\nput level (Xie et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023h).\nWhile some studies have observed and explored\nthe model\u2019s confidence in its output, i.e., logits (Xu\net al., 2023; Jin et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2024b),\nthere has been less focus on the internal mechanism\nof the model, like specific attention heads or neuron\nactivations during conflicts. This gap highlights a\nneed for more microscopic examinations to better\ncomprehend how models decide when encounter\nconflicts. A recent study conducted by Jin et al.\n(2024b) advances this by investigating the inter-\npretability of LLMs through information flow anal-\n\nysis, pinpointing pivotal points for conflict mitiga-\ntion. They discover there are some attention heads\nwith opposite effects in the later layers, where mem-\nory heads can recall knowledge from internal mem-\nory, and context heads can retrieve knowledge from\nthe external context. Inspired by this, Pruning Head\nvia Path Patching is introduced to resolve conflicts\nefficiently without updating model parameters.\n\nMultilinguality. To date, research on knowledge\nconflict has primarily focused on the English lan-\nguage. Future studies could expand in two di-\nrections. Firstly, by examining LLMs to address\nknowledge conflicts in non-English prompts, lever-\naging the many advanced non-English models avail-\nable (e.g., GLM (Zeng et al., 2022) for Chinese)\nor LLMs with multilingual capability (e.g., GPT-\n4 (OpenAI, 2024)) and noting differences from\nEnglish to account for unique language character-\nistics. Secondly, addressing inter-context conflict\nwhere multiple documents in different languages\nmight be retrieved, potentially involving cross-\nlanguage knowledge conflicts. Solutions could\ninclude employing translation systems (Demen-\ntieva and Panchenko, 2021) or, for low-resource\nlanguages, leveraging high-resource language evi-\ndence (Xue et al., 2024) or employing knowledge\ndistillation techniques.\n\nMultimodality. Current research on knowledge\nconflicts mainly focused on the text modality, leav-\ning the study of these conflicts in multimodal con-\ntexts as a promising area for future exploration. As\nLLMs evolve to process information across various\nformats\u2014images (Alayrac et al., 2022; Li et al.,\n2023b), video (Ju et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023b),\nand audio (Borsos et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023)\u2014\nthe potential for conflicts escalates in growing com-\nplexity. For instance, textual documents might\nclash with visual data, or the tone of an audio clip\nmight contradict the content of an accompanying\ncaption. Future research on multimodal knowledge\nconflicts could focus on crafting advanced LLMs\nskilled in cross-modal reasoning and conflict reso-\nlution across diverse data types. This effort neces-\nsitates the enhancement of models\u2019 capabilities to\nnavigate the complex dynamics between different\nmodalities and the development of targeted datasets\nfor effective training and evaluation. Additionally,\nexploring how users perceive and manage multi-\nmodal conflicts, such as discrepancies between text\nand images, will offer valuable insights into im-\nproving LLMs for better human interaction.\n\n\f6 Conclusion\n\nThrough this survey, we have extensively investi-\ngated knowledge conflicts, shedding light on their\ncategorization, causes, how LLMs respond to these\nconflicts, and possible solutions. Our findings re-\nveal that knowledge conflict is a multifaceted is-\nsue, with a model\u2019s behavior being closely tied to\nthe particular type of conflicting knowledge. Be-\nsides, there appears to be a more complex interplay\namong the three types of conflicts. Furthermore, we\nobserve that existing solutions primarily address ar-\ntificially constructed scenarios, neglecting the sub-\ntleties of conflicts by relying on assumed priors and\nthus sacrificing granularity and breadth. Given the\ngrowing use of retrieval-augmented language mod-\nels, we anticipate that knowledge conflicts faced by\nLLMs will only increase in complexity, underscor-\ning the need for more comprehensive research.\n\nLimitations\n\nConsidering the rapid expansion of rese"
