SAD, also known as social phobia, is distinguished as the most frequent anxiety disorder\nand ranks as the second most prevalent among all DSM-IV disorders. It is characterized by an\nintense fear triggered by social situations where the individual fears scrutiny by others. This fear\ncan manifest in various social interactions, such as communicating, eating, or speaking in public,\nand can lead to avoidance behaviors or substantial discomfort when avoidance isn\u2019t feasible. The\navoidance linked with SAD can significantly impair social and occupational functioning, potentially\nleading to social isolation, diminished quality of life, increased unemployment, and reliance on\nsocial welfare. Moreover, SAD often co-occurs with other mental disorders, including depression,\nother anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and personality disorders, with comorbidity rates ranging\nfrom approximately 69% to 99%. The high prevalence of comorbid conditions further complicates\nthe distinction between outcomes attributable to SAD and those related to accompanying disorders.\nNotably, only about 5% of individuals with SAD seek appropriate help, partly because they might\nnot perceive themselves as ill but rather as excessively shy. It\u2019s often the emergence of comorbid\ndisorders, which intensify psychological distress, that prompts those affected by SAD to seek\nmedical assistance [21].\n\n2.2 Public Speaking Disorder\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) represents a significant and underestimated mental health challenge\nwith a lifetime prevalence of 12.1% and is characterized by intense fear and discomfort in social\ninteractions. Research suggests that individuals with SAD hold negative views about their per-\nsonality, social skills, and fear of being embarrassed during social interactions. Public speaking\nanxiety (PSA) is one of the most common fears in teenagers and adults [18]. PSA is classified\nas a type of performance anxiety. Individuals with PSA overestimate the expectations of being\nnegatively evaluated when speaking in front of others and underestimate their capability. This\nfear significantly affects individuals, leading to a wide array of negative outcomes, including social\nisolation, impaired functioning, and substantial distress [9]. The underlying mechanism of this\nanxiety involves individuals\u2019 persistent concern over being negatively judged, leading them to\nanticipate adverse evaluations in social situations [5]. Such anticipatory anxiety not only heightens\ntheir distress during social interactions but also discourages them from engaging in social activities,\npotentially resulting in social withdrawal [22].\n\nThe fear of negative evaluation is central to understanding public speaking anxiety. Individuals\nwith this anxiety often hold negative self-views regarding their appearance, public speaking abilities,\npersonality, and social skills [19]. These negative self-conceptions heighten their sensitivity to\npotential criticism and rejection, fueling their fear of being evaluated unfavorably. The expectation\nof negative evaluation, whether accurate or exaggerated, triggers a cycle of anxiety that can be\ndebilitating [17].\n\nPublic speaking anxiety has significant implications for individuals\u2019 social and professional lives.\nIt can hinder academic and career progress, as affected individuals may avoid situations where\nspeaking in front of others is required, leading to missed opportunities for advancement [26].\nFurthermore, the stress associated with this anxiety can contribute to a range of psychiatric\ncomplications, including depression, substance abuse, and even suicidal ideation, as chronic stress\nand isolation exacerbate underlying mental health issues [23].\n\nResearch indicates that CBT, including exposure to feared situations, cognitive restructuring of\nmaladaptive thoughts, and the development of coping strategies, can be effective in addressing\n\n\fUsage of Virtual Reality in Combating Social Anxiety Disorders in Non-native English Speakers: A Survey\n\n3\n\npublic speaking anxiety [10].

It has been indicated that such adverse experience may have an e\ufb00ect on the\ndeveloping brain [1], the development of depression and anxiety disorders [2]. Trauma\nsurvivors may become vulnerable during the period of time when there is other stress or\nchanges in their lives[3]. Realizing the widespread consequences of CT, several studies\nhave been conducted. Among them, an interesting \ufb01nding is that CT may be transmit-\nted between generations and its intergenerational impact will exist [3]. The mechanism\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fbehind it remains unsolved. Research results in this area proposed that the traumatized\nparents may be functional unavailable for their infant, which resulted in the enhanced\nsymptomatology with their child [8]. Moreover, through parents\u2019 potential traumatizing\nbehavior, child trauma may pass on to the next generation [15]. All the \ufb01ndings indicate\nthe di\ufb03culty in searching for the mechanism of CT transmission.\n\nIt has been studied that the placental corticotrophin-releasing hormone (pCRH) is the\nkey to communicating between the mother and the unborn child[16]. The concentration of\npCRH is highly related to the fetal and infant health development[17]. The pCRH system\nserves as sensor, transducer and e\ufb00ector of the fetal brain development and peripheral\nsystems [19]. Motivated by these \ufb01ndings, a novel biological pathway has been proposed\nby Moog, N.K. et al. [16] to explain the mechanism of CT transmission over generations.\nIn their outstanding work, they built the hypothesis that, through the e\ufb00ect of maternal\nCT exposure on placental-fetal stress physiology, especially pCRH, the intergenerational\ntransmission may take place during gestation[16]. Speci\ufb01cally, their study was conducted\nin a cohort of 295 pregnant women along with their CT exposure measurement. Linear\nmixed e\ufb00ect model and Bayesian piecewise linear models were implemented to show the\nassociation between maternal CT exposure and placental-fetal stress physiology.\n\nIn this study, the dataset consists of pCRH concentrations along with the CT expo-\nsure measurement and other information is obtained after a sociodemographically-diverse\ncohort of 88 pregnant women. The key scienti\ufb01c questions are to study the e\ufb00ect of CT\nexposure on pCRH over gestation (using both frequentist and Bayesian inference) and\nrealize the unneglectable change in the rate of change in pCRH after gestational age goes\nbeyond 20. Motivated by these, this report aims to provide a solution of those questions.\n\n2 Data Description and Statistical Methods\n\n2.1 Observed data\n\nThe dataset in this study was collected during a sociodemographically-diverse cohort of\n88 pregnant women. To measure the CT exposure, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire\nwith 28 items have been assessed. It covered the following \ufb01ve dimensions of childhood\nmaltreatments: emotional abuse (EA), physical abuse (PA), sexual abuse (SA), emotional\nneglect (EN) and physical neglect (PN).

It has been indicated that such adverse experience may have an e\ufb00ect on the\ndeveloping brain [1], the development of depression and anxiety disorders [2]. Trauma\nsurvivors may become vulnerable during the period of time when there is other stress or\nchanges in their lives[3]. Realizing the widespread consequences of CT, several studies\nhave been conducted. Among them, an interesting \ufb01nding is that CT may be transmit-\nted between generations and its intergenerational impact will exist [3]. The mechanism\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fbehind it remains unsolved. Research results in this area proposed that the traumatized\nparents may be functional unavailable for their infant, which resulted in the enhanced\nsymptomatology with their child [8].

Accordingly, stakeholders, including governments' health systems, are developing new strategies to promote early detection and prevention from a holistic perspective (i.e., addressing several disorders simultaneously). In this work, an entirely novel system for the multi-label classification of anxiety and depression is proposed. The input data consists of dialogues from user interactions with an assistant chatbot. Another relevant contribution lies in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for feature extraction, provided the complexity and variability of language. The combination of LLMs, given their high capability for language understanding, and Machine Learning (ML) models, provided their contextual knowledge about the classification problem thanks to the labeled data, constitute a promising approach towards mental health assessment. To promote the solution's trustworthiness, reliability, and accountability, explainability descriptions of the model's decision are provided in a graphical dashboard. Experimental results on a real dataset attain 90 % accuracy, improving those in the prior literature.
