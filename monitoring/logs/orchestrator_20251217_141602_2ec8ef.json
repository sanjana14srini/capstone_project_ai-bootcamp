Historical contexts, national security concerns, and geopolitical implications significantly shape these disputes. While the conflict in Jammu & Kashmir is deeply rooted in its partition history, Arunachal Pradesh's status is contested by China.

Impact of depeering\n\nOnce a depeering occurs, BGP starts announcing the new\nreachability information. Thus, routing is in transient state un-\ntil all the ASes converge to the newly formed topology of the\nInternet. This \ufb01nally leads to frequent BGP announcements,\nrouting loops during the convergence of BGP, etc. Note that\ndisputes are a bigger problem up in the hierarchy of ASes.\nFor example, a dispute at tier-1 is going to be visible to many\nsmall ISPs that take their services to connect to the Internet.\nThis also forces changes in routing paths and the packets may\ntake really long paths or may not even reach to the destination\neven if the paths exist. It is inherent to how BGP works.\n\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nOur work is a \ufb01rst step in the direction of systematically\nanalyzing the disputes and classifying them. We collected over\n26 disputes. We classi\ufb01ed the disputes on grounds like geo-\ngraphical considerations and time line to see how the disputes\nhave varied over different regions and time respectively. We\nhad also came across a dispute that is said to be the \ufb01rst\ncommercial peering dispute, between UUnet and College Park\nNSS in 1989-90, even before the existence of CIX [35]. We\nexpect that there are more disputes like this one, which are\nmissing from our data. In the future, we would like to collect\nmore disputes to make an exhaustive list. Depeering has lot\nof aftermath once it takes place. It also shapes the behavior\nof ISPs. The detailed study of post peering disputes is left as\nfuture work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank everyone who responded\n\nto our queries on the mailing lists, particularly NANOG.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] A.

The dispute\nhas not even started and already its a news, this shows the\neagerness of people to follow such kind of news in the region.\nPeering takes place among the ASes of same Tier and if\nthere is a dispute between two Tier -1 ASes then this means\nthat Internet connectivity is disrupted in some part of the\nworld. In [34], it is explained that peering battle number 1 be-\ntween Cogent and Sprint lead to the breakdown of connectivity\nfor many of their customers (214 ASes were single-homed\nbehind Sprint and 289 were single-homed behind Cogent), and\nwhen such large number of ASes loose their connectivity it is\nbound to become news but why only in the North American\nregion?

Impact of depeering\n\nOnce a depeering occurs, BGP starts announcing the new\nreachability information. Thus, routing is in transient state un-\ntil all the ASes converge to the newly formed topology of the\nInternet. This \ufb01nally leads to frequent BGP announcements,\nrouting loops during the convergence of BGP, etc. Note that\ndisputes are a bigger problem up in the hierarchy of ASes.\nFor example, a dispute at tier-1 is going to be visible to many\nsmall ISPs that take their services to connect to the Internet.\nThis also forces changes in routing paths and the packets may\ntake really long paths or may not even reach to the destination\neven if the paths exist. It is inherent to how BGP works.\n\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nOur work is a \ufb01rst step in the direction of systematically\nanalyzing the disputes and classifying them. We collected over\n26 disputes. We classi\ufb01ed the disputes on grounds like geo-\ngraphical considerations and time line to see how the disputes\nhave varied over different regions and time respectively. We\nhad also came across a dispute that is said to be the \ufb01rst\ncommercial peering dispute, between UUnet and College Park\nNSS in 1989-90, even before the existence of CIX [35]. We\nexpect that there are more disputes like this one, which are\nmissing from our data. In the future, we would like to collect\nmore disputes to make an exhaustive list. Depeering has lot\nof aftermath once it takes place. It also shapes the behavior\nof ISPs. The detailed study of post peering disputes is left as\nfuture work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank everyone who responded\n\nto our queries on the mailing lists, particularly NANOG.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] A.

This \ufb01nally leads to frequent BGP announcements,\nrouting loops during the convergence of BGP, etc. Note that\ndisputes are a bigger problem up in the hierarchy of ASes.\nFor example, a dispute at tier-1 is going to be visible to many\nsmall ISPs that take their services to connect to the Internet.\nThis also forces changes in routing paths and the packets may\ntake really long paths or may not even reach to the destination\neven if the paths exist. It is inherent to how BGP works.\n\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nOur work is a \ufb01rst step in the direction of systematically\nanalyzing the disputes and classifying them. We collected over\n26 disputes. We classi\ufb01ed the disputes on grounds like geo-\ngraphical considerations and time line to see how the disputes\nhave varied over different regions and time respectively. We\nhad also came across a dispute that is said to be the \ufb01rst\ncommercial peering dispute, between UUnet and College Park\nNSS in 1989-90, even before the existence of CIX [35]. We\nexpect that there are more disputes like this one, which are\nmissing from our data. In the future, we would like to collect\nmore disputes to make an exhaustive list. Depeering has lot\nof aftermath once it takes place. It also shapes the behavior\nof ISPs. The detailed study of post peering disputes is left as\nfuture work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank everyone who responded\n\nto our queries on the mailing lists, particularly NANOG.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] A.

As a result, the customers of the ASes often suffer because they cannot reach to the all of the Internet. There is a lack of study of the disputes that have taken place so far, even though each dispute is individually well understood. In this paper, we collect data on 26 disputes from from various resources, categorise them in a systemic manner to understand them from geographical and temporal point of views. There are some ASes that are more involved in disputes than others. In the end, we conclude we need to collect more data as it would be more interesting to have data on the Internet peering disputes around the world.",

This is because of the simple fact that most of the\nTier-1 ASes are based in this region so if there is a dispute of\nthis scale then it is a burning issue in the region.\n\nPlease take a note that a dispute no. 11 between Cogent and\nTelia has been included in two labels of the bar graph, Europe\nand North America for the reason that this dispute had its\neffects in both the regions [17], on the contrary dispute no. 3\nand 5 between Cogent and France Telecom (now Orange S.A.)\nhave been included only in European part because the reason\n\n\fdisputes, unlike other companies that now exist in different\n\ufb01elds like, voice, wavelength services, private line etc. So, if\nyou are in \ufb01eld where every player is so diversi\ufb01ed, disputes\nare inevitable.\n\n[10] B.

Impact of depeering\n\nOnce a depeering occurs, BGP starts announcing the new\nreachability information. Thus, routing is in transient state un-\ntil all the ASes converge to the newly formed topology of the\nInternet. This \ufb01nally leads to frequent BGP announcements,\nrouting loops during the convergence of BGP, etc. Note that\ndisputes are a bigger problem up in the hierarchy of ASes.\nFor example, a dispute at tier-1 is going to be visible to many\nsmall ISPs that take their services to connect to the Internet.\nThis also forces changes in routing paths and the packets may\ntake really long paths or may not even reach to the destination\neven if the paths exist. It is inherent to how BGP works.\n\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nOur work is a \ufb01rst step in the direction of systematically\nanalyzing the disputes and classifying them. We collected over\n26 disputes. We classi\ufb01ed the disputes on grounds like geo-\ngraphical considerations and time line to see how the disputes\nhave varied over different regions and time respectively. We\nhad also came across a dispute that is said to be the \ufb01rst\ncommercial peering dispute, between UUnet and College Park\nNSS in 1989-90, even before the existence of CIX [35]. We\nexpect that there are more disputes like this one, which are\nmissing from our data. In the future, we would like to collect\nmore disputes to make an exhaustive list. Depeering has lot\nof aftermath once it takes place. It also shapes the behavior\nof ISPs. The detailed study of post peering disputes is left as\nfuture work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank everyone who responded\n\nto our queries on the mailing lists, particularly NANOG.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] A.

In  Q3  quartile  journals,  Pakistan  has  14.95%  and  India  has  17.3% \n\npublications in this quartile journals. In Q4 quartile journals, Pakistan has 49.8% and \n\nIndia  has  18.76%  of  publications  in  this  quartile  journals.  Based  on  publications  in \n\ndifferent quartiles, most of the publications from Pakistan\u2019s research community, are in \n\nQ4 quartile journals. While, most of Indian\u2019s research publications are in Q2 quartile \n\njournals. \n\nIndia owns 2 journals from social science domain which lies in Q1 quartiles. 5 journals \n\nin Q2 quartiles are from India. While in Q3 and Q4 quartiles, there are 6 and 5 journals \n\nrespectively  which  are  from  Indian  social  science  journals.  While  talking  about  Q1 \n\nquartiles  journal  from  Pakistan,  none  of  its  journal  qualifies  for  this  category  from \n\nsocial science domain. Only 1 Journal is in Q2 quartiles that is \u2018Pakistan Journal of \n\nInformation  Management  and  Libraries\u2019.  Similarly  there  is  only  one  journal  in  Q3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nquartile  from  Pakistan  research  journals  and  two  of  its  journals  are  in  Q4  quartile \n\njournals.  \n\n4.5   Bibliographic Coupling \n\nThis is another metric to see if some of research groups are bibliographic coupled \n\nor not. If bibliographic coupling exist among different communities then we can say \n\nthat  these  communities  are  working  on  same  or  related  area  of  research.  Hence \n\nsimilarity  can  be  established  among  different  research  communities.  According  to \n\ndefinition bibliographic coupling, if two publications Y and Z cites same publications \n\nA,  B  and  C  then  these  two  publications  Y  and  Z  will  be  bibliographic  coupled \n\npublications. Number of common publications cited by two publications decides how \n\nstrength  of  bibliographic  coupling  among  two  publications  (Park  J.  Y.,  2013).  For \n\nexample if two publications A and B are citing m number of common publications and \n\nother two publications Y and Z are citing m-n number of common publications then \n\nbibliographic coupling among A and B will be stronger as compared to Y and Z. \n\nNow let\u2019s see bibliographic coupling network of Pakistan\u2019s research publications with \n\nrespect to countries. \n\nFigure 7: Bibliographic coupling network of Pakistan research publications \n\n \n \n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nTable 5: Bibliographic Strength of Pakistan research publications \n\nCountry \nUSA \nUK \nMalaysia \nAustralia \nChina \nCanada \nGermany \nIndia \nSaudi Arabia \nFrance \n\nBibliographic Strength \n17322 \n12849 \n9489 \n4891 \n4778 \n4665 \n3552 \n3508 \n3446 \n2898 \n\nAccording  to  clustering  map  and  bibliographic  strength  table,  Pakistan  is  highly \n\ncoupled  with  USA  with  respect  to  Publications.  Means  Pakistan\u2019s  social  science \n\nresearch  community  and  USA\u2019s  research  community  are  citing  many  of  common \n\npublications among their work. We can say that both countries are working on related \n\nproblem. But India comes on 8th number in strength table despite of having same social \n\nissues and cultural background. So indication is, although both countries are working \n\non related areas but they are not bibliographic coupled to that extend.  \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about Bibliographic coupling map of India. \n\n \n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nFigure 8: Bibliographic coupling network of India research publications \n\nTable 6: Link Strength of Bibliographic coupling network of India \n\nCountry \nUSA \nUK \nAustralia \nGermany \nCanada \nNetherlands \nFrance  \nChina \nJapan  \nBrazil \n\nBibliographic Strength \n274721 \n156947 \n85469 \n76553 \n61951 \n61947 \n54974 \n54851 \n51262 \n50488 \n\nWhen we strength table of India\u2019s data then it is clear that Pakistan is not among top \n\nten  countries  which  are  bibliographic  coupled  with  India.  USA  is  among  top.  And \n\nBrazil comes at last of the top ten list. Here important point is none of these countries \n\nmatch with India with respect to Cultural back ground. From this list of countries, only \n\nChina and Japan are from Asia and all of other countries belongs to other continents. \n\nDespite  of  this  factor,  these  countries  are  bibliographic  coupled  with  Indian  social \n\nscience research community. Having similar social issues and resemblance in cultural \n\nback ground, Pakistan is not bibliographic coupled with India to that extend.  \n\n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\n4.6   Key Word Co-occurrence analysis \n\nHaving  common  social  issues  faced  by  both  research  communities  in  India  and \n\nPakistan, our aim is to study whether researchers are doing work in same course or not. \n\nWe can identify different areas of research by extracting author\u2019s defined keywords, by \n\napplying  clustering  techniques  to  highlight  important  words  or  areas  discussed  in \n\nresearch publication (Hofman"

So we \n\ncan  say  that,  authors  from  Pakistan  and  India  are  collaborating  with  other  authors \n\ndepending  upon  basis  of  personal  linkage.  Having  same  social  issues  and  social \n\nbackground is not a key factor in research collaboration among authors. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about co-authorship network of Indian authors. \n\n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nFigure 2: Co-Authorship collaboration network of Indian authors \n\nTable 2: Link Strength table of Co-Authorship collaboration network of Indian \nauthors \n\nCountry \n\nUSA \n\nUK \n\nAustralia \n\nCanada \n\nGermany \n\nNetherlands \n\nFrance \n\nChina \n\nJapan \n\nNetherlands \n\nLink Strength of Co-authorship Network \n\n2315 \n\n938 \n\n384 \n\n359 \n\n281 \n\n274 \n\n192 \n\n166 \n\n166 \n\n45 \n\nThis  map  is  a  collaboration  network  of  Indian  authors  with  authors  of  all  other \n\ncountries.  India  and  Pakistan  are  collaborating  more  or  less  with  same  countries  at \n\ndifferent levels. But, here again, it is clear that collaboration with Pakistani authors is \n\nvery  weak  as  compared  to  other  countries.  Most  of  the  time,  Indian  authors  are \n\ncollaborating with research authors from USA. In above picture, USA and India also \n\nexist in same cluster despite of different regions. In above map, collaboration of authors \n\nrelated to specific regions is visible. For example more than 70% of European countries \n\nexist  in  one  cluster  and  authors  from  these  countries  are  collaborating.  Similarly, \n\n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nauthors  from  Asian  countries  are  displayed  in  one  cluster  e.g  Pakistan,  China,  and \n\nThailand etc. In collaboration map of India, it is also obvious that collaboration with \n\nMuslim countries is not as strong as compare to the other countries. There are different \n\nMuslim  countries  in  Asia  i.e  Pakistan,  Saudi  Arabia,  Indonesia,  Malaysia  etc,  but \n\ncollaboration of Indian authors with these countries is weak as compared to the other \n\ncountries. \n\n4.2   Citation with respect to Countries \n\nAuthor's collaboration can also be measured in terms of citing the same work. Citation \n\nis usually done for giving credits to other researchers, if their collaboration is being \n\nused in current work. Authors working in same domain are more likely to cite research \n\nwork of other authors with same area. For example, authors working on problem A will \n\nlike to cite work of those authors who have been involved in solving related problems. \n\nTo understand citation of authors from Pakistan and India, citation network for both \n\ncountries has been created. Let\u2019s talk about citation pattern of Pakistan\u2019s authors.  \n\nFigure 3: Citation network of Pakistani authors \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nTable 3: Link Strength table of Citation network of Pakistani authors \n\nCountry \nUSA \nUK \nMalaysia \nChina \nAustralia \nSingapore \nCanada \nSouth Africa \nBrazil \nTaiwan \n\nLink Strength of Citation Network \n350 \n256 \n213 \n149 \n139 \n131 \n126 \n122 \n120 \n120 \n\nCitation network of Pakistan is similar to the co-authorship network of Pakistan. From \n\nthis citation network, it is clear that Pakistani authors are not citing research work from \n\nIndian authors as compared to other countries. Authors from Pakistan are citing more \n\nwork done in European countries as seen in the image. Countries collaborating with \n\neach  other  more  frequently  exist  in  one  cluster.  It  is  also  displayed  that  most  of  the \n\nEuropean countries lie in one cluster. India, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Turkey \n\nLie in same cluster. If we see link strength table then it will be clear that most of the \n\ndeveloped countries does not lie in same cluster e.g. USA and UK, Australia lies in \n\ndifferent clusters. China and Canada also lie in different clusters. As stated earlier that \n\nour assumption was; depending upon common social issues, both countries will cite \n\nwork  of  each  other  to  find  common  ground.  But  in  this  case,  it  is  not  true.  Citation \n\npattern is strong with those countries having more collaboration with Pakistani authors.  \n\nNow let\u2019s have a look on citation pattern of India\u2019s research community. \n\n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nFigure 4: Citation network of Indian authors \n\nTable 4: Link strength table of Citation network of Indian authors \n\nCountry \nUSA \nUK \nAustralia \nGermany \nCanada \nNetherland \nChina \nBrazil \nFrance \nJapan \n\nLink Strength of Citation Network \n3580 \n2094 \n796 \n753 \n655 \n606 \n482 \n453 \n443 \n425 \n\nCitation pattern of Indian authors is also related to co-authorship collaboration pattern. \n\nIn citation network although both countries (India and Pakistan) are citing publication \n\nwith  common  top  five  countries  but  clusters  of  these  countries  are  not  same.

For example, authors working on problem A will \n\nlike to cite work of those authors who have been involved in solving related problems. \n\nTo understand citation of authors from Pakistan and India, citation network for both \n\ncountries has been created. Let\u2019s talk about citation pattern of Pakistan\u2019s authors.  \n\nFigure 3: Citation network of Pakistani authors \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nTable 3: Link Strength table of Citation network of Pakistani authors \n\nCountry \nUSA \nUK \nMalaysia \nChina \nAustralia \nSingapore \nCanada \nSouth Africa \nBrazil \nTaiwan \n\nLink Strength of Citation Network \n350 \n256 \n213 \n149 \n139 \n131 \n126 \n122 \n120 \n120 \n\nCitation network of Pakistan is similar to the co-authorship network of Pakistan. From \n\nthis citation network, it is clear that Pakistani authors are not citing research work from \n\nIndian authors as compared to other countries. Authors from Pakistan are citing more \n\nwork done in European countries as seen in the image. Countries collaborating with \n\neach  other  more  frequently  exist  in  one  cluster.  It  is  also  displayed  that  most  of  the \n\nEuropean countries lie in one cluster. India, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Turkey \n\nLie in same cluster. If we see link strength table then it will be clear that most of the \n\ndeveloped countries does not lie in same cluster e.g. USA and UK, Australia lies in \n\ndifferent clusters. China and Canada also lie in different clusters. As stated earlier that \n\nour assumption was; depending upon common social issues, both countries will cite \n\nwork  of  each  other  to  find  common  ground.  But  in  this  case,  it  is  not  true.  Citation \n\npattern is strong with those countries having more collaboration with Pakistani authors.  \n\nNow let\u2019s have a look on citation pattern of India\u2019s research community. \n\n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nFigure 4: Citation network of Indian authors \n\nTable 4: Link strength table of Citation network of Indian authors \n\nCountry \nUSA \nUK \nAustralia \nGermany \nCanada \nNetherland \nChina \nBrazil \nFrance \nJapan \n\nLink Strength of Citation Network \n3580 \n2094 \n796 \n753 \n655 \n606 \n482 \n453 \n443 \n425 \n\nCitation pattern of Indian authors is also related to co-authorship collaboration pattern. \n\nIn citation network although both countries (India and Pakistan) are citing publication \n\nwith  common  top  five  countries  but  clusters  of  these  countries  are  not  same.  These \n\ncountries exist in different clusters indicating that researchers from Pakistan and India \n\nare not working in same pattern for citing work from other countries.  \n\n4.3   Source citation network \n\nSource  is  any  conference  or  journal  where  some  research  work  has  been  published. \n\nCitation of sources may be used to access one\u2019s publication quickly. Sometimes, quality \n\nof publication is also determined based on published source and citation from sources. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPreprint Version \n\nFor example, if research work is published in good journal A and citation is also used \n\nin this publication from good journals then it is considered that this research is good. \n\nSimilarly,  if  research  publication  published  in  some  average  source  B  and  cited \n\npublication\u2019s source is also average then this research work is considered to be average. \n\nThat\u2019s why source is important, for publication and citation as well. For this analysis, \n\nwe have bench marked data and selected at least 20 documents per source.  \n\nFor  Pakistan,  we  "
