Its most important aspects include:\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Weighing**: Self-attention mechanisms weigh input tokens' influence on each other dynamically, based on their contextual embeddings. This adaptability enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, which is crucial for capturing dependencies over long contexts.\n\n2. **Representation of Long-Distance Dependencies**: Self-attention effectively models long-range relationships in sequential data, which is vital for understanding context in natural language processing. This capability has been shown to significantly outperform traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially in handling complex sequences.\n\n3. **Primal Attention Mechanism**: Recent advancements propose adopting a primal representation in self-attention using Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD). This approach optimizes the self-attention process by enhancing efficiency and regularizing attention outputs, resulting in improved performance without the need for extensive computational resources.\n\nUnderstanding these components enhances the design and application of transformer-based models, especially as they are deployed in increasingly complex NLP tasks. \n\n## References\n- [Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19798v2)\n- [D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: A Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00741v1)\n what is the framework behind model context protocol # MCP4EDA: LLM-Powered Model Context Protocol\n\n## Summary \n MCP4EDA introduces the Model Context Protocol, a framework enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to control and optimize the RTL-to-GDSII design flow through natural language interfaces.

Recent research explores these aspects by investigating time-inconsistent, non-Markovian finite-player games, proposing that sub-game perfect equilibria maintain their properties through convergence to mean-field counterparts in large player settings. This ensures that players' strategies remain optimal even as the game evolves over time, capturing both intra-personal and inter-personal strategic dynamics effectively through specialized mathematical frameworks including backward stochastic differential equations. The convergence of these equilibria illustrates the maintainability of Nash properties over infinite games, suggesting foundational implications in game theory and strategy development. \n\n## References\n- [Variance strikes back: sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria in time-inconsistent $N$-player games, and their mean-field sequel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08745v1)\n summary of classical vision models # Classical Vision Models: A Summary\n\n## Summary \n Classical vision models have evolved significantly, particularly with the rise of new technologies such as action cameras and smart glasses, which have introduced First Person Vision (FPV) into the landscape of computer vision.

Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.",

Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.",

              "summary": "The threats faced by cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure have motivated the development of different attack detection mechanisms, such as those that monitor for violations of invariants, i.e. properties that always hold in normal operation. Given the complexity of CPSs, several existing approaches focus on deriving invariants automatically from data logs, but these can miss possible system behaviours if they are not represented in that data. Furthermore, resolving any design flaws identified in this process is costly, as the CPS is already built. In this position paper, we propose a systematic method for deriving invariants before a CPS is built by analysing its functional requirements. Our method, inspired by the axiomatic design methodology for systems, iteratively analyses dependencies in the design to construct equations and process graphs that model the invariant relationships between CPS components. As a preliminary study, we applied it to the design of a water treatment plant testbed, implementing checkers for two invariants by using decision trees, and finding that they could detect some examples of attacks on the testbed with high accuracy and without false positives. Finally, we explore how developing our method further could lead to more robust CPSs and reduced costs by identifying design weaknesses before systems are implemented.",

              "summary": "Greenhouse climate control is concerned with maximizing performance in terms of crop yield and resource efficiency. One promising approach is model predictive control (MPC), which leverages a model of the system to optimize the control inputs, while enforcing physical constraints. However, prediction models for greenhouse systems are inherently inaccurate due to the complexity of the real system and the uncertainty in predicted weather profiles. For model-based control approaches such as MPC, this can degrade performance and lead to constraint violations. Existing approaches address uncertainty in the prediction model with robust or stochastic MPC methodology; however, these necessarily reduce crop yield due to conservatism and often bear higher computational loads. In contrast, learning-based control approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), can handle uncertainty naturally by leveraging data to improve performance. This work proposes an MPC-based RL control framework to optimize the climate control performance in the presence of prediction uncertainty. The approach employs a parametrized MPC scheme that learns directly from data, in an online fashion, the parametrization of the constraints, prediction model, and optimization cost that minimizes constraint violations and maximizes climate control performance. Simulations show that the approach can learn an MPC controller that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of constraint violations and efficient crop growth.",

With mod-\nern greenhouses equipped with actuation systems such\nas heating, ventilation, and CO2 injection, effective con-\ntrol approaches can lead to high crop yield in an energy-\nef\ufb01cient manner. However, the control challenge is dif\ufb01-\ncult as the process dynamics are highly nonlinear and com-\nplex [28], and the climate variables, such as temperature\nand humidity, must be effectively constrained to avoid\ndamage to crops due to, e.g., spread of diseases [6, 34, 11].\nWhile traditional methods, e.g., on-off and PID control,\nhave been used for low-level regulation, these strategies\nare not rooted in optimal control and are in general un-\n\nable to deliver optimal performance and to systematically\nhandle complex state and/or input constraints [12, 15].\n\nModel predictive control (MPC) is an optimization-based\ncontrol methodology that naturally handles multi-input-\nmulti-output systems with state, input, and output con-\nstraints [5]. It has seen huge theoretical success and appli-\ncation in process control, and has been proposed to solve\ngreenhouse control challenges [3, 10, 21]. However, MPC\nrelies heavily on an accurate prediction model, while in a\ngreenhouse prediction model there always exist uncertain-\nties due to, e.g., modeling error and inaccurate weather\nforecasting. For model-based control, an incorrect model\ncan lead the controller to drive the system to an undesired\npoint of operation, possibly violating constraints. Further-\nmore, as constraints often represent the validity range for\nthe accuracy of the prediction model, violations of the con-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fS. Mallick et al.\n\nstraints can lead to degraded performance when applied to\nthe real system [34].\n\nSome existing works have addressed prediction uncer-\ntainty only in the context of external disturbances, such\nas weather predictions [6, 14]. In [8], the uncertainty in\nmarket prices is addressed with a scenario-based stochas-\ntic MPC controller; however, the controller is based on\nmixed-integer optimization, requiring signi\ufb01cant compu-\ntational efforts. Alternatively,\nthe following existing\nworks have explored uncertainty stemming from an incor-\nrect physical model of the system. In [12], the robustness\nof predictive control for a greenhouse in the presence of\nmodel uncertainties is considered empirically, however no\nmechanism to compensate for the prediction error is intro-\nduced. In [19, 20], a neural network is used as a prediction\nmodel, with a robust MPC controller addressing the pre-\ndiction uncertainty; however, a min-max robust MPC ap-\nproach is used, which is inherently conservative. In [34],\nan approach to mitigating the negative effects of model un-\ncertainty is presented using online parameter estimation.\nHowever, only a small subset of the (possibly) uncertain\nmodel parameters are estimated. Of particular note, in\n[4], parametric uncertainty in all model parameters is ad-\ndressed. A robust sample-based MPC controller is pro-\nposed to incorporate the uncertainty into the control ap-\nproach. However, the resulting control scheme is unable\nto adequately reduce constraint violations, and results in\nless crop yield due to conservativeness. More recently,\n[27] has proposed a chance-constrained stochastic MPC\nformulation to address parametric uncertainties in green-\nhouse production systems. However, this approach relies\non linearization of the prediction model, further increas-\ning prediction uncertainty. Additionally, the chance con-\nstrained formulation leads to a computational load that is\nhigher than traditional MPC schemes.\n\nIn contrast to MPC, reinforcement learning (RL) is a\nmodel-free control methodology where a control policy is\nlearned from data observed from the system [26]. RL con-\ntrollers naturally handle uncertainty and adapt to chang-\ning conditions with no additional mechanisms, as they\nare learned through direct interaction with the real system.\nFor complex systems with large continuous state and ac-\ntion spaces, the state-of-the-art for RL uses deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) as function approximators to represent\nthe controller. With the power of DNNs as general func-\ntion approximators, this idea has seen unprecedented suc-\ncess on previously unsolved problems, e.g., the games of\nchess and Go [25]. The power and inherent uncertainty\nhandling of RL has been identi\ufb01ed as useful for green-\nhouse climate control, with [32] proposing a DNN-based\nRL approach based on deep deterministic policy gradient\n(DDPG) [17], and [22] drawing a comparison between\nMPC and DDPG. However, an inherent drawback for RL\ncontrollers is the"
