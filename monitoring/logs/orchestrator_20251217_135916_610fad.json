Furthermore,  this \ndecrease is quite sharp given that the values of the coefficients are very small, ranging from \n0.079 for the top 10% most cited articles in social sciences to 0.321 for the number of articles \nin Natural Sciences and Engineering.

Indeed,  while  we  can  still  observe \ncoefficients below 1 for most indicators once we remove the outliers, the coefficient are much \nhigher for those fields, and it even becomes positive for top cited articles in NSE. Thus, in this \nfield, the decreasing marginal returns observed in terms of top cited articles might be caused \nby  the  presence  of  highly  influential  outliers,  who  obtain  a  lot  of  funding  and  publish  an \nimportant number of important papers.  \n\nFigure 3 shows the scatterplots  with  a fitted  a  LOESS curve  for each field  and indicator.

The purpose of this study is to measure the relation between the amount of funding provided to 12,720 researchers in Quebec over a fifteen year period (1998-2012) and their scientific output and impact from 2000 to 2013. Our results show that both in terms of the quantity of papers produced and of their scientific impact, the concentration of research funding in the hands of a so-called \"elite\" of researchers generally produces diminishing marginal returns. Also, we find that the most funded researchers do not stand out in terms of output and scientific impact.",

The LOESS function fits a polynomial for each point in \na scatterplot using weighted least squares on a subset of the data. More weight is given to the \nclosest neighbours and less to the data points that are further away. We used a 50% smoothing \nparameter  (50%  of  the  data  is  used  to  fit  the  polynomial  on  each  data  point),  to  obtain  a \nsmooth curve that is not overly affected by normal variation in the data. \n\nOutlier analysis \nA  first  visual  of  our  data  displayed  some  obvious  outliers  (e.g.,  heavily  funded  under-\nperformers  and  minimally  funded  over-performers).  To  ensure  that  our  analyses  using  the \nCobb-Douglas and LOESS functions were robust, we performed the analyses on the complete \ndataset as well as in the dataset with the outliers removed. Outliers were identified statistically \nrather  than  manually,  by  running  a  linear  regression  on  the  data  and  calculating  the  Cook\u2019s \ndistance for each data point. We identified as outliers the points with a Cook\u2019s distance higher \nthan a limit obtained with formula 4/(n-k-1), where n is the number of data points and k is the \nnumber of independent variables. \n\nResults \n\nDistribution of research funding \nAs  Figure  1  shows,  research  funding  provided  to  Qu\u00e9bec  researchers  over  the  1998-2012 \nperiod is concentrated in the hands of a minority of researchers. In SS and health, about 20% \nof  the  researchers  shared  80%  of  all  funding  given  during  that  period.  The  funds  were  less \nconcentrated in NSE, where 25% of the researchers shared 80% of the funds, than in the other \nfields.  On  the  whole,  these  results  confirm  that  research  funds  in  Qu\u00e9bec  are  indeed \nconcentrated in the hands of a few researchers. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fFigure 1. Distribution of research funds among all researchers (1998-2012) \n\nSince  we  used  articles  published  before  2013,  our  results  could  be  affected  if  a \ndisproportionately large amounts of funding had been awarded in recent years when the full \noutput  from  those  grants  (in  terms  of  both  productivity  and  impact)  will  not  yet  have  been \nachieved. Thus, we looked the evolution of the total amount of grants received by Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s \nresearchers  over  the  1998-2012  period  (Figure  2).  We  observe  that  funding  in  Health  as \ngreatly increased between 1998 and 2005, and has been relatively stable since then. In NSE, \nwe observe a steady increase, going from 81 to 239 million $CAN over the same period. SS \nresearchers received less funding than their colleagues in Health and NSE. Their total funding \nincreased  from  33  to  72  million  $CAN  between  1998  and  2004  and  has  been  stable  since \nthen.  \n\nFigure 2. Total amount of funding by discipline (1998-2012) \n\nWe  also  looked  at  the  50  largest  grants  in  each  field  to  see  if  a  larger  share  of  them  were \nobtained in the 2010-2013 period. Since it was not the case, it seems reasonable to conclude \nthat the possibly missing output from grants  awarded in the last years of the period will not \naffect our results. \n\nMarginal returns of research funding \nThe  results  of  the  Cobb-Douglas  function  used  to  determine  whether  increased  research \nfunding  yields  increasing,  constant  or  decreasing  marginal  returns,  are  shown  in  Table  2.  It \nprovides the results in terms of the number of articles, the ARC and the number of top cited \n\n0%20%40%60%80%100%Proportion of fundsHealth0%20%40%60%80%100%Proportion of researchersNSE0%20%40%60%80%100%SS050100150200250300350400450Total funding in million Can$HealthNSESS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\farticles  for  each  field,  as  well  as  for  both  the  complete  data  set  and  the  data  set  without \noutliers. \n\nTable 2. Relation between the amount of funding and the research output and impact as \nmeasured by the Cobb-Douglas production function. \n\nFor the complete dataset, the coefficients are all below 1, which means that, in each field and \nfor  each  indicator,  research  funding  yields  decreasing  marginal  returns.  Furthermore,  this \ndecrease is quite sharp given that the values of the coefficients are very small, ranging from \n0.079 for the top 10% most cited articles in social sciences to 0.321 for the number of articles \nin Natural Sciences and Engineering. However, outliers appear to have and  important effect \non  these  coefficients,  especially  in  NSE  and  Health.  Indeed,  while  we  can  still  observe \ncoefficients below 1 for most indicators once we remove the outliers, the coefficient are much \nhigher for those fields, and it even becomes positive for top cited articles in NSE. Thus, in this \nfield, the decreasing marginal returns observed in terms of top cited articles might be caused \nby  the  presence  of  highly  influential  outliers,  who  obtain  a  "
