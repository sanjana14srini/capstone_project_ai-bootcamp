Mean-\nwhile,  shadows  cast  by  the  two  E-W  oriented \nwalls  to  the  west  of  the  entrance  to  the  circular \nroom just reached the entrance at sunset on the \nsolstice  days,  also  allowing  these  specific  days \nto be easily identified. Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019.

Meanwhile, if a N-S orient-\ned  marked  wooden  plank  was  laid  across  the \nroom,  this  also  would  show  the  changing  posi-\ntion  of  the  Sun  at  noon  during  the  year  (Figure \n15), so this room, too, could serve as a calendri-\ncal observatory.   \n\n4  CONCLUSIONS \n\nIt can be safely assumed that astronomers in the \nintellectually-advanced Harappan Civilization had \ndetailed  knowledge  of  positional  astronomy.  \nHowever,  apart  from  some  stray  references \n(e.g. see Maula, 1984; Vahia and Menon, 2011), \nup  to  now  there  has  been  no  positive  identi-\nfication  of  any  structure  or  artefact  with  obvious \ncelestial  associations  at  any  of  the  1500  or  so \nknown Harappan archaeological sites.   \n\nThe  Bailey  structure  at  Dholavira  is  the  first \nHarappan  structure  that  seems  to  have  been \nconstructed specifically in response to the solar \ngeometry  at  the  site,  and  it  is  highly  probable \nthat the two circular rooms in the structure were \ndesigned  for  solar  observations.    If  this  suppo-\nsition  is  correct,  then  this  is  the  first  identified \nHarappan  example  of  a  building  that  was  used \nspecifically  for  observational  astronomy.    We \nwould  argue,  however,  that  similar  structures \nmust  have  existed  at  all  major  Harappan  cities, \nand the identification of other examples is simp-\nly a matter of time.   \n\nFinally,  we  should  mention  that  since  the \nDholavira  was an important centre  of trade and \ncommerce,  keeping  track  of  time  would  have \nbeen crucial, but to  date  no  structures  that  ob- \n\nviously served this purpose have been identified.  \n\n5  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the funding for \nthe  project  from  the  Jamsetji  Tata  Trust  under \nthe  programme,  \u2018Archaeo-astronomy  in  Indian \nContext\u2019. We also wish to gratefully acknowledge \nthe permission given to us by the Archaeological \nSurvey of India to survey Dholavira in 2007, 2008 \nand  2010.

To date there is no generally accepted decipherment of these sign sequences and there have been suggestions that the signs could be non-linguistic. Here we apply complex network analysis techniques to a database of available Indus inscriptions, with the aim of detecting patterns indicative of syntactic organization. Our results show the presence of patterns, e.g., recursive structures in the segmentation trees of the sequences, that suggest the existence of a grammar underlying these inscriptions.",
              "content": "there-\nfore intriguing to consider whether network analysis can\nreveal the similarities and di\ufb00erences between such dis-\ntinct systems of writing, and moreover, if it can be used\nto distinguish structural features characterising writing\n(i.e., any system of recording language by visible or tac-\ntile marks [10]) from non-writing.\n\nThis is especially important, as it is clear from observ-\ning many of the earliest examples of writing that have\nbeen deciphered, that \u201cno writing system was invented,\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\for used early on, to mimic spoken language or to per-\nform spoken language\u2019s function\u201d [12]. Instead, writing\nwas used to record information such livestock or ration\naccounts, land grants, o\ufb00ering lists, lexical lists, divina-\ntions, etc., whose storage by verbal or spoken means was\ndi\ufb03cult and unreliable; thus the principal function of\nearly writing was decontextualization and storage [13]. In\nalmost all cases, a writing system became more or less ca-\npable of expressing spoken language only after centuries\nof development, a process of development that can be\nclearly seen in Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian and Mayan\nwriting [12]. It is therefore important to broaden the re-\nsults of network analysis of linguistic corpora by applying\nsuch analytical techniques to inscriptions recorded using\ndi\ufb00erent writing systems, and, even to undeciphered in-\nscriptions for which the underlying writing system is un-\nknown.\n\nIn this article, we look at a corpus of inscriptions ob-\ntained through archaeological excavations carried out in\nthe ruins of the Indus valley civilization. The inscrip-\ntions are in the form of short linear sequences of signs,\nof which there are a few hundred di\ufb00erent types. Ever\nsince their discovery in the early part of the 20th cen-\ntury, there have been attempts at deciphering these in-\nscriptions. However, to date there has been no generally\naccepted method of interpreting them. We analyze a\ncomprehensive database of these sequences using tech-\nniques inspired by complex network theory. Our aim is\nto see whether such methods can reveal the existence of\npatterns suggesting syntactic organization in the sign se-\nquences.\nIn the next section, we brie\ufb02y introduce the\nhistorical context of the Indus inscriptions, while in Sec-\ntion 3, we discuss the data-set on which analysis has been\ncarried out. Our results are reported in Section 4, and we\n\ufb01nally conclude with a discussion of unresolved questions\nand further work that needs to be carried out.\n\nTHE INDUS INSCRIPTIONS\n\nThe Indus civilization, also known as the Mature\nHarappan civilization (2500 \u2212 1900 BCE), was geograph-\nically spread over what is now Pakistan and northwest-\nern India, covering approximately a million square kilo-\nmeters [14].\nIt was marked by urbanization centered\naround large planned cities, as seen from the ruins of\nHarappa and Mohenjo-daro. Craft specialization and\nlong-distance trade with Mesopotamia and Central Asia\nhave been well-demonstrated. This civilization came to\nan end early in the 2nd millennium BC. There were\nno historical records of its existence until archaeologi-\ncal excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\nuncovered artifacts and some of the ruined urban cen-\nters [15]. Among the artifacts uncovered during these\ndiscoveries were a variety of objects (especially seals)\nthat were inscribed with a variety of signs arranged in\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Impression made from Seal no. H99-4064 obtained\nin Harappa (Mound F, Trench 43) by the HARP team. The\ninscription at the top is one of the longest sequences in the\nWUCS data-set, being 13 signs long. The lower panel shows\nthe inscription separately, with the ID number for each sign\ngiven according to the W09IMSc sign list. The seal is made\nof steatite, having dimensions 5.7 cm \u00d7 5.7 cm.

Although found primarily on seals\nand their impressions (sealings), inscriptions with simi-\nlar signs have also been discovered on miniature tablets,\npottery, copper tablets, bronze implements, etc. Unsur-\nprisingly, given the high sophistication of the civilization\nand the level of social complexity it implies, with the\nconcomitant requirements of coordination and communi-\ncation, these inscriptions have been interpreted as cor-\nresponding to writing. However, despite periodic claims\nabout decipherment of this writing system, there has as\nyet been no generally accepted interpretation of the signs.\nDespite the lack of success in understanding what the se-\nquences represent, it has been generally agreed that the\ninscriptions were written from right to left in the vast\nmajority of cases, although a few examples written from\nleft to right or top to bottom or in boustrephedon are\nknown [16\u201318].\n\nThe failure of decipherment is partly due to lack of\nknowledge about the language which t"

Craft specialization and\nlong-distance trade with Mesopotamia and Central Asia\nhave been well-demonstrated. This civilization came to\nan end early in the 2nd millennium BC. There were\nno historical records of its existence until archaeologi-\ncal excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries\nuncovered artifacts and some of the ruined urban cen-\nters [15]. Among the artifacts uncovered during these\ndiscoveries were a variety of objects (especially seals)\nthat were inscribed with a variety of signs arranged in\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Impression made from Seal no.

Although found primarily on seals\nand their impressions (sealings), inscriptions with simi-\nlar signs have also been discovered on miniature tablets,\npottery, copper tablets, bronze implements, etc. Unsur-\nprisingly, given the high sophistication of the civilization\nand the level of social complexity it implies, with the\nconcomitant requirements of coordination and communi-\ncation, these inscriptions have been interpreted as cor-\nresponding to writing. However, despite periodic claims\nabout decipherment of this writing system, there has as\nyet been no generally accepted interpretation of the signs.\nDespite the lack of success in understanding what the se-\nquences represent, it has been generally agreed that the\ninscriptions were written from right to left in the vast\nmajority of cases, although a few examples written from\nleft to right or top to bottom or in boustrephedon are\nknown [16\u201318].\n\nThe failure of decipherment is partly due to lack of\nknowledge about the language which the signs encode\nand the lack of any bilingual texts such as the Rosetta\nstone which was crucial in deciphering Egyptian hiero-\n\n\fglyphs. While there is disagreement on the exact num-\nber of unique and distinct signs that occur in the in-\nscriptions, there is overall agreement that they lie in the\nrange of a few hundred. This rules out the possibility\nthat the signs belong to (a) an alphabetic system, which\ncontains on average about 25 letters (such as the Ro-\nman or Latin alphabet, used for writing most European\nlanguages including English), (b) a syllabic system con-\nsisting of around 100 signs (such as the kana system for\nwriting Japanese) or (c) an ideographic writing system\n(e.g., Chinese), comprising more than 50,000 characters.\nHowever, the number of Indus signs is in the same range\nas the number of distinct signs used by logo-syllabic writ-\ning systems, such as Sumerian cuneiform for which the\ntotal number of independently occurring signs has been\nestimated to be around 900 [10]"

Instead, writing\nwas used to record information such livestock or ration\naccounts, land grants, o\ufb00ering lists, lexical lists, divina-\ntions, etc., whose storage by verbal or spoken means was\ndi\ufb03cult and unreliable; thus the principal function of\nearly writing was decontextualization and storage [13]. In\nalmost all cases, a writing system became more or less ca-\npable of expressing spoken language only after centuries\nof development, a process of development that can be\nclearly seen in Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian and Mayan\nwriting [12].

(2010-05-27). This study analyzes inscriptions from the Indus Valley civilization to reveal syntactic patterns, suggesting the existence of a grammar behind the undeciphered writing system. [Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4997)\\n\\nThese findings collectively enhance our understanding of the Harappan civilization's sophistication in urban planning, trade, astronomy, and communication. Further studies are encouraged to explore additional research articles that can provide broader insights into this ancient civilization's complexity and contributions to society.\",\"references\":[{\"title\":\"A possible Harappan Astronomical Observatory at Dholavira\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6474\"},{\"title\":\"Network analysis of a corpus of undeciphered Indus civilization inscriptions indicates syntactic organization\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4997\"}]}"
